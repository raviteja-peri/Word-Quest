authoring tool issues authoring tools are an essential element in achieving a universal accessible web the ideal authoring tools produce accessible robust web content regardless of the technical knowledge of the content authors they are also accessible in themselves example  a developer creates an interface for uploading images to an events page although she includes the option to add alternative text descriptions with the images its hard to find where to add them and her interface doesnt require or encourage it as a result most images on the pages dont have text alternatives thus making it is impossible for many bots and for many users with disabilities to get meaning from the photos example  a developer is constructing a blogging interface for englishwelsh bilingual users these are users who speak both english and welsh and articles and comments entered in one language are frequently replied to in the other as comments are added each page becomes a mixture of both languages unfortunately the generated markup fails to apply an appropriate lang attribute  en for english cy for welsh  to each block of content on the page as a result many bots and users with disabilities find half of the content unreadable example  the owner of a popular blog wants to offer his most insightful thoughtful comment contributors the opportunity to guestauthor for a week around the theme of the right to self expression recently the most sparkling comment repartee is from a user with low vision and a dry wit and she is duly invited to guestauthor the blog content is highly accessible so she had always found adding a comment straightforward increasing the text size and leading and changing the colours to suit her preference the blogs back end authoring environment however has not been built with accessibility in mind after a frustrating couple of hours she gives up in disgust a great opportunity is missed accessibility guidelines for authoring tools wc
