architecture focuses on the foundation technologies and principles which sustain the web including uris and http architecture principles web architecture principles help to design technologies by providing guidance and articulating the issues around some specific choices identifiers we share things by their names url uri iri is the way to name things on the web and manipulate them some additional addressing needs in the web services stack motivated some additional layers protocols protocols are the vehicle for exchanging our ideas http is the core protocol of the web wc is also working on xml protocols and soap in relation to web services meta formats xml the extensible markup language is used to build new formats at low cost due to widely available tools to manipulate content in those new formats rdf and owl allow people to define vocabularies ontologies of terms as part of the semantic web protocol and meta format considerations documents on the web are loosely joined pieces by identifiers it creates a maze of rich interactions between protocols and formats internationalization wc has worked with the community on the internationalization of identifiers iris and a general character model for the web news announcing the unicode standard version   june  from internationalization activity blog  wcwebarchitecture version  of the unicode standardis now available adding  new characters this latest version adds the new currency symbols for the russian ruble and azerbaijani manat approximately  emoji pictographic symbols many other symbols and  new lesserused and historic scripts as well as character additions to many existing scripts these additions extend support for written languages of north america china india other asian countries and africa see the link above for full details most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in longstanding and widespread use in wingdings and webdings fonts major enhancements were made to the indic script properties new property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to rendering indic scripts these include properties for joining behavior new classes for numbers and a further division of the syllabic categories of viramas and rephas with these enhancements the default rendering for newly added indic scripts can be significantly improved unicode character properties were extended to the new characters the old characters have enhancements to script and alphabetic properties and casing and linebreaking behavior there were also nearly  new cantonese pronunciation entries as well as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable implementations two other important unicode specifications are maintained in synchrony with the unicode standard and have updates for version  these will be released at the same time uts  unicode collation algorithm the standard for sorting unicode text uts  unicode idna compatibility processing for processing of nonascii urls idns last call draft published for encoding spec  june  from internationalization activity blog  wcwebarchitecture a last call working draft of encodinghas been published while encodings have been defined to some extent implementations have not always implemented them in the same way have not always used the same labels and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings this specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can converge the body of this spec is an exact copy of the whatwg version as of the date of its publication intended to provide a stable reference for other specifications we are hoping for people to review the specification and send comments about any technical areas that need attention see the status section for details please send comments by  july  capability urls we need your feedback  may  from wc tag lines the battle for web security and privacy is fought at many levels sometimes common practice in web application design can lead to data leakage with untended consequences for users a good example of this came up recently where confidential files shared through common webbased document sharing services were being exposed unintentionaly to third parties because the private urls used to share them had been unintentionally leaked dropbox and box leaked shared private files through google httptcohvuselxvzv @slashdot  cf httptcomjhphsstdcc @jenit  daniel appelquist @torgo may   urls that allow a user to access an otherwise privileged resource or information are called capability urls and while they can be powerful they can also cause potential problems when used improperly tag member jeni tennison has been working on a draft defining the space of capability urls and outlining some good practices for usage we think this document should be useful for web builders who are thinking about incorporating this pattern into their applications we think its pretty good but we need your feedback before we finalize it and release it as a tag finding the draft may be found here httpwwwworgtrcapabilityurls and if you have feedback you are encouraged to raise an issue on github or email us on the tag public mailing list thanks new version of unicode ideographic variation database released  may  from internationalization activity blog  wcwebarchitecture the unicode consortium is pleased to announce the release of version  of the unicode ideographic variation database ivd this release registers the new moji_joho collection along with the first  sequences in that collection  of which are shared by the registered hanyodenshi collection

francisco called the extensible web summit as i wrote before the event the intention was to bring together web developers and web platform developers from the local area to discuss upcoming indevelopment web platform technologies and standards both to throw a spotlight on some of the topics we think are key and to guide the tags thinking judging from the feedback weve received i we achieved these goals and more there were quite a few positive views shared on twitter including epic day at the extwebsummit devs standards and implementors all working together really excited about the future of the web platform  erik bryn @ebryn april   learning about serviceworkers networking apis for things like offline cache httpstcowxxmndti extwebsummit  ans @anselmbradford april

from fields such as localization language technology browser development content authoring and tool development etc to create a holistic view of the interoperability needs of the multilingual web we look forward to seeing you in madrid the extensible web summit  march  from wc tag lines were running an event on friday the  thof april in san francisco and youre invited for the past year alongside our regular facetoface meetings the tag has been holding evening developer meetups under the moniker meet the tag the radical idea has been to take advantage of the fact that our meetings are happening in cities with large concentrations of web developers to connect with these developer communities in a meaningful and useful way the hopeful outcome is to both keep developers informed about what were doing presumably on their behalf with their platform and to drive some feedback back into the tag to help guide our thinking and our work the results have generally been good generating useful criticism and feedbackwhich weve tried to take on board and making the tag less of an echo chamber in the mean time weve met lots of developers who take a keen interest in web architecture and the future of the web platform for our next facetoface meeting in san francisco were planning to expand this idea to a fullfledged oneday event bringing in web developers and web platformdevelopers people who are deeply invested in the web platform but may not be participating directly in standards were calling this event the extensible web summit as twitter denizen daniel buchner put it @briankardell @wycats @wctag are you telling me were going to try developing api products using direct customer feedback mind  blown  daniel buchner @csuwildcat december   the web is  years old what do we want this platform to look like  years from now this event will bring together web platform developers and practitioners from different communities and backgrounds to focus on the future of the web architecture and platform with the exception of some curated lightning talks at the beginning of the day to set the scene the event will be run as an unconference with the agenda selforganized by the participants wed like to thank adobe systems for stepping forward as our host for this event who should attend we would ideally like to pack this event with platform developers framework
