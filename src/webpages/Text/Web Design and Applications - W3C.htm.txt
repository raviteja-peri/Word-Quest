fundamental technologies for building web pages html html and xhtml for structure css for style and layout including webfonts find resources for good web page design as well as helpful tools javascript web apis standard apis for clientside web application development include those for geolocation xmlhttprequest and mobile widgets wc standards for document models the dom and technologies such as xbl allow content providers to create interactive documents through scripting graphics wc is the home of the widely deployed png raster format svg vector format and the canvas api webcgm is a more specialized format used for example in the fields of automotive engineering aeronautics audio and video some of the wc formats that enable authoring audio and video presentations include html svg and smil for synchronization wc is also working on a timed text format for captioning and other applications accessibility wcs web accessibility initiative wai has published web content accessibility guidelines wcag to help authors create content that is accessible to people with disabilities waiaria gives authors more tools to create accessible web applications by providing additional semantics about widgets and behaviors internationalization wc has a mission to design technology that works across cultures and languages wc standards such as html and xml are built on unicode for instance in addition wc has published guidance for authors related to language tags bidirectional bidi text and more mobile web wc promotes one web that is available on any device wcs mobile web best practices help authors understand how to create content that provides a reasonable experience on a wide variety of devices contexts and locations privacy the web is a powerful tool for communications and transactions of all sorts it is important to consider privacy and security implications of the web as part of technology design learn more about tracking and web app security math on the web mathematics and formula are used on the web for business reports education materials and scientific research wcs mathml enables mathematics to be served received and processed on the world wide web just as html has enabled this functionality for other types of content news html on our way to recommendation  june  from wc html working group in  the html working group chairs came up with a plan to progress html aka  plan  the plan has several objectives produce a wc recommendation for html  before the end of  as well as a wc recommendation for html  before the end of  use the candidate recommendation of html which started in december  to focus the testing effort where it is appropriate use modularity to manage the size and complexity of the specifications over the past  years we have continued to refine and improve the html  specification the html working group receives and tracks proposals from a variety of people in the community most prominently from the whatwg during the past  years the html editors have worked with the community to exchange ideas and thus avoid divergence among specifications the html landscapelists the differences between various html specifications the html working group today has  tests for html as part of satisfying the wc process requirements for candidate recommendation we have tracked implementations of html features and test results today show that there are at least  implementations for  of the available tests what about the other  those failures arise from how different browsers handle errors and the working group has concluded that these failures do not reflect differences in implementations that will significantly affect interoperability of realworld running code following the test results we removed several features from html due to their lack of implementations and stability including the dialog element and scoped style sheet those features remain in the draft html  specification for the time being wc would like to thank the community for helping to build this valuable test suite the tests come from the test the web forward community effort and the contributors to the webplatformtests github repository and we strongly encourage web developers to continue to contribute to the testing effort and help make the open web platform reliable at the moment the html working group is specifically looking for additional html  tests related to media elements and page navigation as planned given the substantive changes made to the document were returning html  to last call the scope of the expected feedback at this point is limited to changes that have taken place during the candidate recommendation phase and the deadline is  july  once we have addressed the last call comments and finalize the test suite we expect to move the document to proposed recommendation in the fall a few features may be removed from html  but kept in html  if we cant get enough implementations the datacue interface input typetime drag and drop and the new ruby model advancing html  towards recommendation status is just one step in advancing the open web platform a fullfledged programming environment for rich interactive crossplatform applications with html at its core several groups are extending the html markup language including for responsive design performance accessibility or additional security purposes the html working group the wc technical architecture group and the web applications working group are looking to have an extensible web summit in the middle of september where we will discuss the future of html we expect a formal announcement in early july announcing the unicode standard version   june  from internationalization activity blog  wcwebdesign version  of the unicode standardis now available adding  new characters this latest version adds the new currency symbols for the russian ruble and azerbaijani manat approximately  emoji pictographic symbols many other symbols and  new lesserused and historic scripts as well as character additions to many existing scripts these additions extend support for written languages of north america china india other asian countries and africa see the link above for full details most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in longstanding and widespread use in wingdings and webdings fonts major enhancements were made to the indic script properties new property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to rendering indic scripts these include properties for joining behavior new classes for numbers and a further division of the syllabic categories of viramas and rephas with these enhancements the default rendering for newly added indic scripts can be significantly improved unicode character properties were extended to the new characters the old characters have enhancements to script and alphabetic properties and casing and linebreaking behavior there were also nearly  new cantonese pronunciation entries as well as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable implementations two other important unicode specifications are maintained in synchrony with the unicode standard and have updates for version  these will be released at the same time uts  unicode collation algorithm the standard for sorting unicode text uts  unicode idna compatibility processing for processing of nonascii urls idns workshop report summary of the ldlt group kickoff  lider roadmapping workshop  june  from internationalization activity blog  wcwebdesign the lider project has published a report on the first linked data for language technology event which was held st march in alignment with the european data forum in athens read the report industry stakeholders from many areas localization publishing language technology applications etc and key researchers from linked data and language technology discussed promises and challenges around linguistic linked data the report summarizes all presentations and includes an initial list of use cases and requirements for linguistic linked data this and the overall outcome of the event will feed into work of the ldlt group see especially the ldlt latest draft version of use cases and the field of multilingual linked data in general the ldlt group is part of the multilingualweb community  learn more about related projects last call draft published for encoding spec  june  from internationalization activity blog  wcwebdesign a last call working draft of encodinghas been published while encodings have been defined to some extent implementations have not always implemented them in the same way have not always used the same labels and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings this specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can converge the body of this spec is an exact copy of the whatwg version as of the date of its publication intended to provide a stable reference for other specifications we are hoping for people to review the specification and send comments about any technical areas that need attention see the status section for details please send comments by  july  updates to two working group notes published  june  from internationalization activity blog  wcwebdesign authoring html handling righttoleft scripts and authoring html language declarationshave both been updated to a new format that lists dos and donts but points to existing or new articles for detailed information this will significantly help in keeping the material up to date in the future as technology changes the documents have also been thoroughly overhauled to reflect the latest changes and information on the first document provides advice to content authors using html markup and css style sheets about how to create pages for languages that use righttoleft scripts such as arabic hebrew persian thaana urdu etc it explains how to create content in righttoleft scripts that builds on but goes beyond the unicode bidirectional algorithm as well as how to prepare content for localization into righttoleft scripts the second helps content authors specify the language of content which is useful for a wide number of applications from linguisticallysensitive searching to applying languagespecific display properties in some cases the potential applications for language information are still waiting for implementations to catch up whereas in others it is a necessity today adding markup for language information to content is something that can and should be done now and as content is first developed if not it will be much more difficult to take advantage of any
