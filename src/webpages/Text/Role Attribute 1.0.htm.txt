integrated into any markup language in particular schema implementations are provided to facilitate with languages based upon xhtml modularization xhtmlmodularizatione the role attribute is necessary to support accessible rich internet applications waiaria waiaria to define roles in xmlbased languages when the languages do not define their own role attribute although this is the reason the role attribute is published by the protocols and formats working group the attribute has more general use cases as well status of this document this section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication other documents may supersede this document a list of current wc publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the wc technical reports index at httpwwwworgtr this is the role attribute wc recommendation by the protocols  formats working group of the web accessibility initiative this document has been reviewed by wc members by software developers and by other wc groups and interested parties and is endorsed by the director as a wc recommendation it is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document wcs role in making the recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment this enhances the functionality and interoperability of the web as a finalized document this version of the role attribute is not likely to undergo further changes the protocols and formats working group expects that any further enhancements to the role attribute would take place in a future version of accessible rich internet applications waiaria instead of in a future version of this specification the working group does not plan to make formal responses to comments on the role attribute recommendation but will consider input for errata or other future work start with the instructions for commenting page to submit comments preferred or send email to

and semantic markup of documents it has been developed in conjunction with the accessibility community and other groups to make it easier to describe the semantic meaning of document content an important though not exclusive use case for the role attribute is to support waiaria the role attribute meets the requirements of role attribute in waiaria section  enabling xml languages that incorporate this attribute to use waiaria roles at time of this publication no xmlbased languages are known to use waiaria but this attribute is important to enable planned future support such as in svg by contrast support for waiaria in html includes an attribute named role the use of that attribute within html is consistent with the definition of the role attribute in this specification although conforming use may be limited to the use of terms within the value of the attribute  conformance as well as sections marked as nonnormative all authoring guidelines diagrams examples and notes in this specification are nonnormative everything else in this specification is normative the key words must must not required should should not recommended may and optional in this specification are to be interpreted as described in rfc  document conformance the role attribute does not represent a standalone document type it is intended to be integrated into other host languages such as svg html or xhtml a conforming role attribute document is a document that requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this specification and the facilities described as mandatory in its host language such a document must meet all the following criteria the document must conform to the constraints expressed in its host language implementation if the host language is an xml xmle markup language and is in the xhtml namespace httpwwwworgxhtml there are no additional requirements if the host language is an xml markup language and is not in the xhtml namespace and the host language does not incorporate this attribute in no namespace then the document must contain an xml namespace declaration for the role attribute module namespace xmlnames the namespace for role attribute module is defined to be httpwwwworgxhtml an example start tag of a root element might look like example  mylang xmlnshttpwwwexamplecomdtdmylang         xmlnsxhhttpwwwworgxhtml xmllangen   host language conformance when the role attribute is included in a host language all of the facilities required in this specification must be included in the host language in addition the attribute defined in this specification must be included in the content model of the host language  the role attribute this specification defines the role attribute the role attribute takes as its value one or more whitespace separated termorcurieorabsiris which is defined in rdfacore each component of the value maps to an iri that corresponds to a vocabulary term that should be defined using rdf note the datatype used for @role permits the use of a term a curie as defined in rdfacore or a full iri a term is an item from a vocabulary the default vocabulary for use with @role is defined in xhtmlvocab a host language may define a different default vocabulary note the specific vocabulary terms from the default vocabulary are not included in this document they are defined in xhtmlvocab to ease maintenance the terms are drawn from waiaria and from the original work on this document by the xhtml working group the attribute describes the roles the current element plays in the context of the document this can be used for example by applications and assistive technologies to determine the purpose of an element this could allow a user to make informed decisions on which actions may be taken on an element and activate the selected action in a device independent way it could also be used as a mechanism for annotating portions of a document in a domain specific way eg a legal term taxonomy although the role attribute may be used to add semantics to an element authors should use elements with inherent semantics such as p rather than layering semantics on semantically neutral elements such as div roleparagraph the following is an example of a good appropriate use of the role attribute example  div rolemain  hthis is the main content of the pageh  phere is some content that is the primary purpose of this web pagepdiv  extending the collection of roles it is possible to define additional role values vocabulary authors must define such additional role values in their own vocabulary the uri associated with that vocabulary should resolve to a resource that allows for the machine and human discovery of the definition of the roles in the vocabulary note a good example of such a resource is the default vocabulary document at xhtmlvocab this document uses a format compatible with the requirements of rdfacore section  for machinediscoverable rdfa initial contexts  using role in conjunction with rdfa if a host language contains the @role attribute then an rdfa processor processing a document written in that host language according to the rules of that host language may generate additional triples for role attributes if these additional triples are being generated then they must be generated as follows if @id is present it is used to supply the subject by concatenating the documents base a fragment separator  and the value of @id otherwise the subject is a unique newly created bnode the predicate is the term role in the vocabulary defined at httpwwwworgxhtmlvocab each value of @role is an object forming an rdf triple with the subject and predicate defined above an rdfa processor must behave as if there is an inscope vocabulary of httpwwwworgxhtmlvocab for the values of the @role attribute note remember that @role values are defined using the datatype termorcurieorabsiris an rdfa processor will intepret these values using the rules for that that datatype as defined in rdfacore a xhtml role attribute module a dtd implementation the dtd implementation of xhtml role attribute module conforms to the requirements defined in xhtmlmodularizatione consequently it provides a qualified names declaration module a qualified names module note that this module defines the parameter entity xhtmlroleattrsqname this entity is intended to be used in the attribute lists of elements in any host language that permits the use of the role attribute on elements in its own namespace if a host language does not permit role in its namespace then the host language driver should set a parameter entity xhtmlroleprefixed to include and a parameter entity xhtmlroleprefix to a value that is the prefix for the xhtml role attribute
