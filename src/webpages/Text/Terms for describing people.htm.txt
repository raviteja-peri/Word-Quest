requirements are common to all uc for example we could say that a requirement must at least show up in half of the uc etc  what is a person the core concept we are dealing with in this document is that of a person a person in the context of this specification is defined as an entity of type foafperson if only the persons name is known foafname must be used httpdatasccgovorgpeoplebjrkg rdftype

information best practice  deriving domainspecific person types one sometimes finds specialisations of a person in a domain for example in the legal domain there is a distinction made between a natural person and a legal person in such a case the publisher should in addition to the domainspecific type eg legalnaturalperson explicitly set the type foafperson in order to increase interoperability this also allow systems that do not perform reasoning for example plain sparql processors to benefit from it read more   relating a person to other entities beyond stating the basic characteristics of a person one can relate a person to a target entity such as an organisation or project the following sections normatively specify how to do this for any target entity type not listed in the below sections the publisher is free to use any appropriate vocabulary see also the @@link vocabulary selection section of the best practices for publishing linked data document for
