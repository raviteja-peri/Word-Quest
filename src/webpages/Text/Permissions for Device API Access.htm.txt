this section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication other documents may supersede this document a list of current wc publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the wc technical reports index at httpwwwworgtr this first public working draft represents the early consensus of the group on what identifiable permissions should look like and they encompass the group is now looking for feedback on this approach and its applicability to various use cases including widgets configurations installable web applications existing permissions verifications this document was published by the device apis and policy working group as a working draft this document is intended to become a wc recommendation if you wish to make

this is a draft document and may be updated replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time it is inappropriate to cite this document as other than work in progress this document was produced by a group operating under the  february  wc patent policy wc maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent an individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains essential claims must disclose the information in accordance with section  of the wc

geolocation a contacts a media capture a file a system information b references b normative references b informative references  introduction a number of web apis in particular those used to access private or sensitive data from the hosting device are meant to be discoverable as well as disabled or enabled on a sitebysite or applicationbyapplication basis depending on the security context for instance the feature element as defined in the widget packaging and configuration specification widgets allows a widget runtime engine to grant access only to the specific apis that the configuration file of the widget listed this document identifies and names the various permissions that are attached to existing web apis  permissions each permission described in this document is identified using a string specified in this document where these permissions needed to be identified as a uri eg in a widget configuration file widgets a uri can be built from these strings by appending that string to the base httpwwwworgnsapiperms the dap base uri is entirely tentative at this stage  geolocation api the geolocation identifier corresponds to the access to both or either of the geolocationgetcurrentposition and geolocationwatchposition methods defined in the geolocation api geolocationapi in the web browser environment this permission is usually granted through explicit users consent and is retained for later access in the same session  contact api the contactsread identifier corresponds to the access to the contactsfind method defined in the contacts api contactsapi in the web browser environment this permission is usually granted implicitly by asking the user to select what data of which contacts should be shared for each call to the said method  capture api the mediacapture identifier corresponds to the access to the capturecaptureimage capturecapturevideo and capturecaptureaudio methods defined in media capture api mediacaptureapi in the web browser environment this permission is usually granted implicitly by asking the user to activate a button to start and stop the recording operations for each call to the said methods  file api the fileread identifier corresponds to the access to the filereaderreadasarraybuffer filereaderreadasbinarystring filereaderreadastext and filereaderreadasdataurl methods defined in the file api fileapi in the web browser environment this permission is usually granted implicitly once the file object has been created after the user has selected a file from a file picker and is retained for later access in the same browsing context the filewrite identifier corresponds to the access to the filewriterwrite filewritertruncate filewritersyncwrite and filewritersynctruncate methods defined in the file writer api filewriter in the web browser environment this permission is usually granted implicitly once the filesaver object has been created after the user has selected a path to which the data can be saved eg through a save as dialog  system information api the deviceinfo identifier corresponds to the access to the data of the power cpu thermal avcodecs storage outputdevices inputdevices properties available through the systeminfoget and systeminfowatch methods defined in the system information api sysinfoapi the networkinfo identifier corresponds to the access to the data of the network property available through the systeminfoget and systeminfowatch methods defined in the system information api sysinfoapi the sensorinfo identifier corresponds to the access to the data of the ambientlight ambientnoise ambienttemperature ambientatmosphericpressure and proximity properties available through the systeminfoget and systeminfowatch methods defined in the system information api sysinfoapi in the web browser environment these permissions are usually granted through explicit users consent and are retained for later access in the same session a mapping to bondi features and android permissions this section maps the permissions defined in this document to bondi  feature strings bondifeatures and corresponding android permissions bondi  feature uris are formed by appending the bondi string to the base uri httpbondiomtporgapi bondi and android values are only given as examples note also that this section might contain errors bondi and android meanings may not correspond as shown and even if the names are similar they may not be equivalent a geolocation wc api permissions bondi  feature android permissions identifier scope identifier scope geolocation
