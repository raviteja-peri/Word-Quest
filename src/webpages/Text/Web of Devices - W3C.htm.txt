working draft of encodinghas been published while encodings have been defined to some extent implementations have not always implemented them in the same way have not always used the same labels and often differ in dealing with undefined and former proprietary areas of encodings this specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders and existing implementations can converge the body of this spec is an exact copy of the whatwg version as of the date of its publication intended to provide a stable reference for other specifications we are hoping for people to review the specification and send comments about any technical areas that need attention see the status section for details please
