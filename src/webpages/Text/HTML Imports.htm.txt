explicitly marked as nonnormative everything else in this specification is normative the key words must must not required shall shall not should should not recommended may and optional in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in rfc for readability these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification any point at which a conforming ua must make decisions about the state or reaction to the state of the conceptual model is captured as algorithm the algorithms are defined in terms of processing equivalence the processing equivalence is a constraint imposed on the algorithm implementors requiring the output of the both uaimplemented and the specified algorithm to be exactly the same for all inputs dependencies this document relies on the following specifications dom dom core html dom parsing and serialization ecmascript language specification url terminology html imports or just imports from here on are html documents that are linked as external resources from another html document the document that links to an import is called an import referrer for any given import an import referrer ancestor is its import referrer or any import referrer ancestor of its import referrer an import referrer which has its own browsing context is called a master document each import is associated with one master document if the referrer of the import is a master document it is the master document of the import otherwise the master document of the import referrer is the master document of the import imported documents share its defaultview with the master document see bug  and bug  the url of an import is called the import location in the import referrer an import is represented as a document called the imported document the imported documents dont have browsing context the set of all imports associated with the master document forms an import map of the master document the maps stores imports as its items with their import locations as keys the import map is empty at beginning new items are added to the map as import fetching algorithm specifies link type import to enable declaring imports in html a new link type is added to html link types the import keyword may be used with link elements this keyword creates an external resource link to an import the default type for resources given by the import keyword is texthtml the link element may have an async attribute the async attribute is a boolean attribute the appropriate time to obtain the resource is when the external resource link is created or when its element is inserted into a document whichever happens last the following document has one import located at importshearthtml doctype htmlhtml langenus    head        titlehuman beingtitle        link

importhtmllinkelement implements linkimport on getting the import attribute must return null if the link does not represent an import the user agent does not support imports the link element is not in a document otherwise the attribute must return the imported document for the import represented by the link element the same object must be returned each time heres how one could access the imported document mentioned in the previous example var link  documentqueryselectorlinkrelimportvar heart  linkimport access dom of the document in importshearthtmlvar pulse  heartqueryselectordivpulse an import in the context of the document of an html parser or xml parser is said to be an import that is blocking scripts if the element was created by that documents parser or and the element is a link of type import when the element was created by the parser and the link is not marked as async and the the import is yet to be completely loaded and the last time the event loop has reached step  the element was in that document and the user agent hasnt given up on that import yet a user agent may give up on an import at any time giving up an import before it loads even if the import eventually does still load means that the script might end up operating with incorrect information for example if an import registers a custom element and a script relies on the availability of this element the script will find that this element is unavailable if the user agent gives up early implementors have to balance the likelihood of a script using incorrect information with the performance impact of doing nothing while waiting for a slow network request to finish a document has an import that is blocking scripts if there is an import that is blocking scripts in the documents import dependent a document has no import that is blocking scripts if it does not have an import that is blocking scripts as defined in the previous paragraph the sate of has an import that is blocking scripts can change each time an existing import is completely loaded or new import loading is started html parser has changes to unblock it for each of such timings loading imports import dependent each document has an import link list each of whose item is consist of link the link element and location a url also the item is optionally marked as cycle the list is empty at beginning and the item is added as import request altorighm specifies an imported document has zero or more import ancestors the import ancestor is a document if the import link list of document a contains an noncycle item whose location points document b a is a import ancestor of b b is also called the import parent of the document the import ancestor is transitive if document c is a import ancestor of document b and document b is a import ancestor of document a c is a import ancestor of document a an imported document also has one or more import predecessor the import predecessor is a document if the url of document a is located before the url of document b in the import link list of bs import parent a is import predecessor of b the import predecessor is transitive if document a is import predecessor of document b and b is redecessor of document c a is import predecessor of c the document that is in either import ancestors or import predecessors of document a or is linked from noncycle item of as import link list is the import dependent of a the import link list and the import dependent constrains the order of script execution in imports it is intend to give a deterministic order of script execution which is defined by the order of link element in each import the linking structure of import link lists forms a directed asyclic graph dag each node of the dag is a document and its edge is a link it cannot be a tree because more than one link can point same import any cycle is marked by the import request algorithm and excluded from dependency calculation the edges of each node is ordered in terms of import link list the import predecessors selection is aware of the order an example of import link lists in the figure the document a has an import link list which contains a link to b and another link to c the document d has a set of import ancestors that are a b and c as b is a import ancestor of d one of ds list item that points b is marked as cycle the import predecessors of e are b and d its import ancestors are a and c and its import link list is empty thus its import dependents are a b c and d the document d has two import parents which are b and c the difference between the import referrer and the import parent is that import referrer reflects the state of the node tree and that the import parent is built by the algorithm described in this document requesting import when user agents attempt to obtain a linked import they must also run the import request algorithm which is equivalent to running these steps input link the link element that creates an external resource link to the import location the url of the linked resource if the async attribute of link is true mark link as async let document be a document of link let list be an import link list of document let item be link and location if there is a import ancestor of document whose url is same as location mark item as cycle add item at the end of list fetching import all imports linked from documents that is the master document or the one in the import map must be loaded using potentially corsenabled fetch with mode set to anonymous when an import is fetched the user agent must run the import fetching algorithm which must be equivalent to running these steps input link a link element which makes the external resource link to the import location the import location output import the imported document if location is already in the import map let import be the imported document for location and stop fetch a resource from location with import as overnride referrer source and block cookies flag set if fetched response type is error add location and null to the import map and stop let import be a new document the documents address of which is location set import no quirks mode let parser be a new html parser associated with import input a doctype token to parsers tree construction stage with name html and forcequirks flag turned off see bug  add location and import to the import map for each task that the networking task source places on the task queue while fetching fill parsers input byte stream with the fetched bytes let parser process the input byte stream with utf as a known definite encoding when no more bytes are available queue a task from the networking task source for parser to process implied eof character all of loaded imports and imports under loading are in the import link list thus every import which is linked from imports in the list will also be loaded using the import fetching algorithm with location be the import location of the import the loading attempt must be considered successful if import is not null on the algorithm completion and failed otherwise the link element fires a simple event called load for successful loading attempt for failed attempt it fires a simple event named error imports and content security policy content security policy must restrict import loading through the scriptsrc directive each import must be restricted by the content security policy of the master document for example if content security header field is sent to an import the user agent must enforce the policy of the master document to the imported document parsing imports parsing behaviour of imports is defined as a set of changes to the html parsing additions to prepare a script algorithm in step  of prepare a script algorithm modify the last part of condition which begins with if element does not have a src attribute to read  and the document of the html parser or xml parser that created the script element has a style sheet that is blocking scripts or has an import that is blocking scripts additions to tree construction algorithm in subcondition named otherwise of condition an end tag whose name is script in text insertion mode modify step  to read if the parsers document has a style sheet that is blocking scripts or has an import that is blocking scripts or the scripts ready to be parserexecuted flag is not set spin the event loop until the parsers document has no style sheet that is blocking scripts and has no import that is blocking scripts and the scripts ready to be parserexecuted flag is set modify substep  of step  of the end to read spin the event loop until the first script in the list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing has its ready to be parserexecuted flag set and the parsers document has no style sheet that is blocking scripts and has has no import that is blocking scripts all import dependents must be loaded before domcontentloaded is fired see bug  additions to parsing xhtml documents modify step  of steps that run following preparing the script element to read spin the event loop until the parsers document has no style sheet that is blocking scripts and has no import that is blocking scripts and the pending parsingblocking scripts ready to be parserexecuted flag is set additions to documentwrite method insert following step between step  and step  of documentwrite method if documentcurrentscript points the element that isnt owned by the active document then abort these steps see bug  scripting in imports additions to script enabling criteria add following condition to the list of enabling and disabling scripting criteria scripting is enabled for a node if the document object of the node is in the import map additions to documentcurrentscript modify the definition of documentcurrentscript as follows the currentscript attribute on getting must return the value to which it was most recently initialized in the document or the import map of the document when the document is created the currentscript must be initialized to null if the document is an imported document its currentscript is always null style processing with imports the contents of the style elements and the external resources of the link elements in imports must be considered as input sources of the style processing model of the master document between declarations from different documents the document order in terms of order of appearance is defined based on the document order of the link elements of their import referrer ancestors which are in the same document if thre are more than one of such documents the comparison result in the first document in the document order wins see bug  events in imports events in imports is defined as a set of changes to the html events additions to event handlers modify the event handler content attributes script creation criteria by expanding the first paragraph when an event handler content attribute is set if the element is owned by a document that is in a browsing context or in an import map  acknowledgements david hyatt developed xbl  and ian hickson cowrote xbl  these documents provided tremendous insight into the problem of behavior attachment and greatly influenced this specification alex russell and his considerable forethought triggered a new wave of enthusiasm around the subject of behavior attachment and how it can be applied practically on the web dominic cooney and roland steiner worked tirelessly to scope the problem within the confines of the web platform and provided a solid foundation for this document the editor would also like to thank alex komoroske angelina fabbro anne van kesteren boris zbarsky brian kardell daniel buchner edward oconnor eric
