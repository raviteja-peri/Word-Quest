css namespaces module defines the syntax for using namespaces in css it defines the @namespace rule for declaring the default namespace and binding namespaces to namespace prefixes and it also defines a syntax that other specifications can adopt for using those prefixes in namespacequalified names css is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents such as html and xml on screen on paper in speech etc status of this document this section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication other documents may supersede this document a list of current wc publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the wc technical reports index at httpwwwworgtr this document was produced by the css working group as a recommendation this document has been reviewed by wc members by software developers and by other wc groups and interested parties and is endorsed by the director as a wc recommendation it is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document wcs role in making the recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment this enhances the functionality and interoperability of the web wc encourages everybody to implement this specification comments may be sent to the archived public mailing list wwwstyle@worg see instructions when

qualified names changes acknowledgments references normative references informative references index property index  introduction this section is nonnormative this css namespaces module defines syntax for using namespaces in css it defines the @namespace rule for declaring a default namespace and for binding namespaces to namespace prefixes it also defines a syntax for using those prefixes to represent namespacequalified names it does not define where such names are valid or what they mean that depends on their context and is defined by a host language such as selectors select that references the syntax defined in the css namespaces module note that a css client that does not support this module will if it properly conforms to csss forwardcompatible parsing rules ignore all @namespace rules as well as all style rules that make use of namespace qualified names the syntax of delimiting namespace prefixes in css was deliberately chosen so that these css clients would ignore the style rules rather than possibly match them incorrectly  conformance a document or implementation cannot conform to css namespaces alone but can claim conformance to css namespaces if it satisfies the conformance requirements in this specification when implementing css or another host language that normatively references this specification conformance to css namespaces is defined for two classes style sheet a css style sheet or a complete unit of another host language that normatively references css namespaces interpreter someone or something that interprets the semantics of a style sheet css user agents fall under this category the conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of descriptive assertions and rfc  terminology the key words must must not required shall shall not should should not recommended may and optional in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in rfc  however for readability these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification all of the text of this specification is normative except sections explicitly marked as nonnormative examples and notes rfc examples in this specification are introduced with the words for example or are set apart from the normative text with classexample like this this is an example of an informative example informative notes begin with the word note and are set apart from the normative text with classnote like this note this is an informative note  terminology besides terms introduced by this specification css namespaces uses the terminology defined in namespaces in xml  xmlnames however the syntax defined here is not restricted to representing xml element and attribute names and may represent other kinds of namespaces as defined by the host language in css namespaces a namespace name consisting of the empty string is taken to represent the null namespace or lack of a namespace for example given the namespace declarations   @namespace empty   @namespace  the type selectors elem elem and emptyelem are equivalent  declaring namespaces the @namespace rule the @namespace atrule declares a namespace prefix and associates it with a given namespace name a string this namespace prefix can then be used in namespacequalified names such as the css qualified names defined below   @namespace httpwwwworgxhtml  @namespace svg httpwwwworgsvg the first rule declares a default namespace httpwwwworgxhtml to be applied to names that have no explicit namespace component the second rule declares a namespace prefix svg that is used to apply the namespace httpwwwworgsvg where the svg namespace prefix is used in css namespaces as in namespaces in xml  the prefix is merely a syntactic construct it is the expanded name the tuple of local name and namespace name that is significant thus the actual prefixes used in a css style sheet and whether they are defaulted or not are independent of the namespace prefixes used in the markup and whether these are defaulted or not for example given the following xml document   qmlelem xmlnsqmlhttpexamplecomqmarkupqmlelem and the following @namespace declarations at the beginning of a css file   @namespace q httpexamplecomqmarkup  @namespace lq httpexamplecomqmarkup the selectors qelem and lqelem in that css file would both match the element qmlelem the selector qmlelem would be invalid because css namespaces only recognize prefixes declared in css not those declared by the document language  syntax the syntax for the @namespace rule is as follows using the notation from the grammar appendix of css  css   namespace     namespace_sym s namespace_prefix s stringuri s  s      namespace_prefix     ident     with the new token @namespace return namespace_sym any @namespace rules must follow all @charset and @import rules and precede all other nonignored atrules and style rules in a style sheet for css syntax this adds  namespace scdocdc  immediately after  import scdocdc  in the stylesheet grammar a syntactically invalid @namespace rule whether malformed or misplaced must be ignored a css style sheet containing an invalid @namespace rule is not a valid style sheet a uri string parsed from the uri syntax must be treated as a literal string as with the string syntax no urispecific normalization is applied all stringsincluding the empty string and strings representing invalid urisare valid namespace names in @namespace declarations  scope the namespace prefix is declared only within the style sheet in which its @namespace rule appears it is not declared in any style sheets importing or imported by that style sheet nor in any other style sheets applying to the document  declaring prefixes a namespace prefix once declared represents the namespace for which it was declared and can be used to indicate the namespace of a namespacequalified name namespace prefixes are like css counter names casesensitive if in the namespace declaration the namespace prefix is omitted then the namespace so declared is the default namespace the default namespace may apply to names that have no explicit namespace prefix modules that employ namespace prefixes must define in which contexts the default namespace applies for example following xmlnames in selectors select the default namespace applies to type selectorsbut it does not apply to attribute selectors there is no default value for the default namespace modules that assign unqualified names to the default namespace must define how those unqualified names are to be interpreted when no default namespace is declared note note that using default namespaces in conjunction with type selectors can cause uas that support default namespaces and uas that dont support default namespaces to interpret selectors differently if a namespace prefix or default namespace is declared more than once only the last declaration shall be used declaring a namespace prefix or default namespace more than once is nonconforming  css qualified names a css qualified name is a name explicitly located within associated with a namespace to form a qualified name in css syntax a namespace prefix that has been declared within scope is prepended to a local name such as an element or attribute name separated by a vertical bar uc the prefix representing the namespace for which it has been declared indicates the namespace of the local name the prefix of a qualified name may be omitted to indicate that the name belongs to no namespace ie that the namespace name part of the expanded name has no value some contexts as defined by the host language may allow the use of an asterisk  ua as a wildcard prefix to indicate a name in any namespace including no namespace given the namespace declarations   @namespace toto httptotoexampleorg  @namespace httpexamplecomfoo in a context where the default namespace applies totoa represents the name a in the httptotoexampleorg namespace b represents the name b that belongs to no namespace c represents the name c in any namespace including no namespace d represents the name d in the httpexamplecomfoo namespace the syntax for the portion of a css qualified name before the local name is given below both for qualified names that allow wildcard prefixes wqname and for qualified names that disallow wildcard prefixes qname the syntax uses notation from the grammar appendix of css  css note this means that comments but not white space are implicitly allowed between tokens   qname_prefix     namespace_prefix       wqname_prefix      namespace_prefix          qname     qname_prefix ident      wqname     wqname_prefix ident      wqwname     wqname_prefix  ident        css qualified names can be used in for example selectors and property values as described in other modules those modules must define handling of namespace prefixes that have not been properly declared such handling should treat undeclared namespace prefixes as a parsing error that will cause the selector or declaration etc to be considered invalid and in css ignored for example the selectors module select defines a type selector with an undeclared namespace prefix to be an invalid selector and css css requires style rules with an invalid selector to be completely ignored changes changes made since the  september  recommendation added predefined qname wqname and wqwname productions to make those constructs easier for other specs to use acknowledgments this draft borrows heavily from earlier drafts on css namespace support by chris lilley and by peter linss and early
