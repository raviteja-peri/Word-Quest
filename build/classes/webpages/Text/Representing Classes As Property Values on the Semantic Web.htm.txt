values in owl and rdf schema it is often convenient to put a class eg animal as a property value eg topic or book subject when building an ontology while owl full and rdf schema do not put any restriction on using classes as property values in owl dl and owl lite most properties cannot have classes as their values we illustrate the direct approach for representing classes as property values in owlfull and rdf schema we present various alternative mechanisms for representing the required information in owl dl and owl lite for each approach we discuss various considerations that the users should keep in mind when choosing the best approach for their purposes status of this document this section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication other documents may

progress general issue it is often convenient to put a class eg animal as a property value eg topic or book subject when building an ontology while owl full owl overview and rdf schema rdfs do not put any restriction on using classes as property values in owl dl and owl lite most properties cannot have classes as their values use case example suppose we have a set of books about animals and a catalog of these books we want to annotate each catalog entry with its subject which is a particular species or class of animal that the book is about further we want to be able to infer that a book about african lions is also a book about lions for example when retrieving all books about lions from a repository we want books that are annotated as books about african lions to be included in the results more specifically consider two book examples  lions life in the pride which is a book that presents an introduction to lions describing their physical characteristics habitat young food predators and relationship to people and  the african lion which describes the physical characteristics habitat and behavior of the african lions we would like to specify that the first book describes the animal species of lion and the second describes a species of african lion we also want to retrieve the second book when a query is about lions not just african lions we consider species of animals to be subjects of the books and would like to use the dublin core property dcsubject for this annotation furthermore we would like to use as our subjects various species from an existing class hierarchy of different animal species we examine representation of this information in owl and rdf schema and suggest different ways of capturing this information in owl dl and owl lite one goal of the web publisher is to enable maximum reuse of published information it will be common on the semantic web to import and reuse other published ontologies any reuse of existing ontologies on the semantic web in our case a hierarchy of animal species should preserve the original intended semantics in the new context if the semantics changes other applications already using the ontology may be adversely affected interoperation with existing applications using this ontology will also be errorprone since there will be two different interpretations of the same ontology some of the patterns that we suggest below change the interpretation of the hierarchy of classes used for property values we suggest that users take this approach only if they know that no one will be adversely affected by such reinterpretation other use case scenarios this issue arises in general when we have a hierarchy of classes and would like to use it as a terminology to annotate other classes or individuals consider using a hierarchy of different genres to annotate music cds or linking classes or individuals in an ontology to the corresponding terms in a standard reference terminology for example umls is a standard reference terminology for many medical applications one may want to have a hasdiagnosis relation from an instance of a patient to a class representing a disease indicating the patient was diagnosed with that disease other use cases for using classes as property values include metamodeling and semantic interoperability between systems this note uses a particular example classes as the subjects of books to illustrate a more general representation issue using classes as property values this note should not be interpreted as a general discussion of how to represent subject hierarchies or terminologies on the semantic web notations in all the figures below ovals represent classes and rectangles represent individuals the orange color signifies classes or individuals that are specific to a particular approach green arrows with green labels are owl annotation properties we use n syntax to represent the examples approaches approach  use classes directly as property values in the first approach we can simply use classes from the subject hierarchy as values for properties in our example as values for the dcsubject property we can define a class book to represent all books for simplicity in the hierarchy of animals we omit classes for other animals such as mammals and felines figure  figure  using classes directly as property values here is a definition of an individual a specific book that we are annotating with the corresponding subject for simplicity we assume that each book discusses only one species of animal lionslifeinthepridebook  a book   rdfsseealso httpisbnnu   booktitle lions life in the pride   dcsubject lion  the book the african lion will be represented as theafricanlionbook  a book   rdfsseealso httpisbnnux   booktitle the african lion   dcsubject africanlion  and the class africanlion is a subclass of the class lion africanlion  a owlclass  rdfssubclassof lion  considerations when choosing approach  the resulting ontology is compatible with rdf schema and owl full but it is outside owl dl and owl lite this approach is probably the most succinct and intuitive among all the approaches proposed here applications using this representation can directly access the information needed to infer that lion the subject of the lionslifeinthepridebook individual is a subclass of animal and that africanlion the subject of the theafricanlionbook individual is a subclass of lion if we need to restrict the range of values for the dcsubject property then we need to create an additional class for such a restriction for instance we may want to define a class of all books about animalsbookaboutanimalsthat our animal books will be instances of and we want to restrict the range of values for the dcsubject property for the bookaboutanimals class to the class animal and its subclasses one way to define such restriction is as follows bookaboutanimals  a owlclass   rdfssubclassof book   rdfssubclassof   a owlclass   owlunionof  a owlrestriction   owlonproperty dcsubject   owlhasvalue animal     a owlrestriction   owlonproperty dcsubject   owlsomevaluesfrom   a owlrestriction   owlonproperty rdfssubclassof  owlhasvalue animal        here we say that the class bookaboutanimals is a subclass of the class book the class bookaboutanimals is also a subclass of the class of all things that must have either the class animal itself or any class that is a subclass of animal as one of the values of the dcsubject property owl code for approach  n rdfxml summary of approach  this approach is a good one to use if you care about simplicity do not have to be in owl dl and either do not need to limit the range of the dcsubject values or do not care that you also need to use classes as subjects to implement this restriction approach  create special instances of the class to be used as property values we can treat the hierarchy of animal species as a hierarchy of subjects create individuals corresponding to all the subjects and use these individuals as values for the dcsubject property figure  figure  using a hierarchy of subjects and a parallel set of subject individuals thus we will have for example an individual lionsubject that will be an instance of the lion class  lionsubject  a lion  we can then use the lionsubject as the value of the property dcsubject for the lionslifeinthepridebook individual lionslifeinthepridebook  a book   rdfsseealso httpisbnnu   booktitle lions life in the pride   dcsubject lionsubject  considerations when choosing approach  the resulting ontology is compatible with rdf schema and owl lite and hence owl dl the class lion has an instance that is the subject lion creating an instance of the lion class to represent a specific lion at the zoo would be inconsistent with this interpretation therefore we will need to have a different class to represent lions at the zoo this change has important implications if the hierarchy of animals is not created by us but we imported it from somewhere else applications will interpret the reference to imported classes according to their original definitions other ontologies importing the same hierarchy of animals will in fact use the original definition therefore there may be inconsistency not only in our own interpretation but also when our ontology is integrated with others importing the same resource this consideration is not a problem when interoperability is not an issue in this approach there is no explicit direct relation ie a relation that a generalpurpose reasoner can readily identify between the lionsubject individual defined above and for example an africanlionsubject individual which is an instance of africanlion africanlionsubject  a africanlion  an application trying to utilize this relation for example to extract books about african lions when asked for books about lions will need to be aware of this specific approach and know to trace back to the corresponding classes their subclasses and respective instances a generalpurpose reasoner will not be able to use this information directly note however that the individual africanlionsubject is also an instance of the lion class therefore if we ask for all books where dcsubject is an instance of the lion class we will get the books that are annotated with africanlionsubject there is a maintenance penalty we need to maintain a set of instances for all subjects in addition to the hierarchy of subjects and ensure that the two setsclasses representing subjects and corresponding individualsare consistent with each other eg that they have the same names etc however developers can instrument tools that would maintain this consistency automatically some may consider this approach to be too messy for the simple task at hand defining a range restriction for the dcsubject property for the class bookaboutanimals is straightforward we define a somevaluesfrom restriction that states that some values of the dcsubject property are instances of the class animal  bookaboutanimals  a owlclass   rdfssubclassof   a owlrestriction   owlsomevaluesfrom animal   owlonproperty dcsubject    owl code for approach  n rdfxml summary of approach  this approach results in an owl dl ontology and may be a good one to use if staying in owl dl is important the approach has a potential disadvantage of having actual subject values be unrelated to one another and hence not allowing a generalpurpose reasoner to relate books with a subject lion to books with a subject african lions for example furthermore if the hierarchy of animals is imported and the source uses the hierarchy to describe actual animals using this approach is inconsistent with this interpretation you need to maintain consistency between the set of classes representing subjects and the set of corresponding individuals approach  create a parallel hierarchy of instances as property values we can create a single class subject and make all the subjects to be individuals that are instances of this class subject figure  lionsubject  a subject   rdfsseealso lion  figure  using a property other than rdfssubclassof to organize the subject hierarchy we can use the annotation property rdfsseealso to link the lionsubject individual to the lion class note that rdfsseealso is an annotation property and hence giving it a value that is a class does not take us out of owl dl in this approach we are essentially using individuals as surrogates for classes we can then create explicit relations between different subjects which will recreate the hierarchy for animals that we have in mind parentsubject  a owltransitiveproperty  owlobjectproperty   rdfsdomain subject   rdfsrange subject   rdfsseealso httpwwwworgskoscorebroader  africanlionsubject  a subject   rdfsseealso africanlion   parentsubject lionsubject  while we create our own property parentsubject we can also use the corresponding properties from the skoscore  schema which is an rdf schema for representing thesauri and similar types of knowledge organization systems so for example parentsubject is similar to skosbroader the skos schema provides a rich vocabulary for handling subject hierarchy with additional properties such as skosnarrower skosrelated and so on considerations when choosing approach  the resulting ontology is compatible with rdf schema and owl lite and hence owl dl however note that rdf schema does not have transitive properties thus we will not be able to express the transitivity of the parentsubject property in rdf schema most dl reasoners will be able to infer transitive relations between subjects such as the fact that animalsubject is a parentsubject of africanlionsubject however a dl reasoner will not be able to infer that a book that has lionsubject as the value for dcsubject is also about animals more specialized reasoners may be able to infer this information the resulting hierarchy of subjects is not related to or dependent on the class hierarchy representing the same topics in this case animals except through an annotation property rdfsseealso annotation properties however are usually ignored by inference engines some may consider the approach of having two parallel hierarchies representing essentially the same information to be too complicated and difficult to maintain for the simple task at hand this approach explicitly separates the subject terminology from the corresponding ontology many consider this separation a good modeling practice the semantics of a subject lion can be different from the semantics of the class of lions having subjects in a separate hierarchy would allow us to define for example that the subject africa is a parent subject of the subject africanlion the separation of the subject terminology from the corresponding ontology incurs a serious maintenance penalty we need to maintain a set of instances for all subjects in addition to the hierarchy of subjects in many applications we may also need to ensure that the two setsclasses representing subjects and corresponding individuals and values for the parentsubject propertyare consistent with each other however developers can instrument tools that would maintain this consistency automatically defining a range restriction for the dcsubject property for the class bookaboutanimals is straightforward we restrict the values of the dcsubject property to the instances of the class subject  bookaboutanimals  a owlclass   rdfssubclassof   a owlrestriction   owlsomevaluesfrom subject   owlonproperty dcsubject    owl code for approach  n rdfxml summary of approach  this approach may be a good one to use if staying within owl dl is important it also allows you to use a dl reasoner to infer transitive relationships between subjects it does carry the penalty of having two parallel hierarchies approach  create a special restriction in lieu of using a specific value this approach enables us to use a dl reasoner to infer for example that a book that has lion as a subject also has animal as its subject in this approach we create a new class to represent a class of all books with a particular subject for example we create a class bookaboutlions to represent all books that have lion as one of their subjects we then assign a subject to a specific book by making the book an instance of one of these classes instead of explicitly setting a property value for the instance thus for example the individual lionslifeinthepridebook will be an instance of the class bookaboutlions figure  we create similar classes for any subject category of books that we are interested in such as bookaboutanimals bookaboutafricanlions  figure  using members of a class as values for properties the key in this pattern is the definition of the new book classes because these classes represent all the books about a particular subject we include subject in the definition the following for example is the definition of the class bookaboutlions bookaboutlions  a owlclass   owlequivalentclass   a owlclass   owlintersectionof  a owlrestriction   owlonproperty dcsubject   owlsomevaluesfrom lion    book    a specific instance of this class lionslifeinthepridebook would then be defined as follows lionslifeinthepridebook  a bookaboutlions   rdfsseealso httpisbnnu   booktitle lions life in the pride  the code above says literally that this book instance lionslifeinthepridebook is an instance of a class all of whose members have at least one instance of the class lion as the value for the dcsubject property in owl it is not necessary to create any explicit instances of these classes that we use in the somevaluesfrom restriction eg lion above in figure  we include these instances in the diagram as if they were explicit and use dotted lines to denote that they may not actually exist this approach approximates the interpretation that we used in the previous approaches by using unspecified members of a class rather than the class itself as property values figure  we define the class bookaboutanimals as a class of books where the subject is some unidentified animal or animals similarly a bookaboutlions class will be a class of books where a subject is some unidentified lion or lions a dl reasoner will be able to classify lionslifeinthepridebook as an instance of the class bookaboutanimals note that there a correspondence between the hierarchy of classes of books on specific subjects such as bookaboutanimals bookaboutlions and bookaboutafricanlions and the classes in the species hierarchy that we use as subjects animal lion africanlion the hierarchy of books essentially parallels the hierarchy of subjects although it does not have to have a book class corresponding to each subjectsonly the subjects that we are interested in if the book classes are defined as above a dl reasoner will be able to infer automatically the hierarchy of book classes based on the hierarchy of subjects there is a variant to this approach in which we merge the two steps into one instead of creating an explicit named class bookaboutlions and then creating an instance of this class we create the instance and assign its type to be an anonymous class of type owlrestriction in this variant there is no explicitly named class corresponding to bookaboutlions for example we can define lionslifeinthepridebook as follows lionslifeinthepridebook  a book   a owlrestriction   owlonproperty dcsubject   owlsomevaluesfrom lion    rdfsseealso httpisbnnu   booktitle lions life in the pride  considerations when choosing approach  the resulting ontology is compatible with owl dl since this approach uses restrictions which do not have any semantics in rdf schema we cannot use this approach for rdf schema the interpretation of this pattern is different from interpretations of the other patterns in this note the subject of the book is one or more specific lionsindividuals in the lion classrather than the lion class itself  in this case a book about lions is a book about some lions even if that happens to be all lions a description logic reasoner will be able to classify automatically the individual lionslifeinthepridebook that has an instance of a lion class as its subject as an instance of both the class bookaboutlions and bookaboutanimals it will also be able to classify the class bookaboutlions defined above as a subclass of the class bookaboutanimals defined in a similar way this approach is likely to be the easiest approach to use if you would like to employ dl reasoning to classify books based on their subjects many would consider it more cumbersome to express a simple fact that the subject of a book is lions by creating a new usually anonymous restriction class and making that class to be the type of the book owl code for approach  n rdfxml summary of approach  this approach can make the most use of dl reasoners it represents a different interpretation of the subject as being a prototypical instance of a class rather than a whole class of things or a specific subject corresponding to that class with the understanding that you are using a different interpretation this approach may be a good one to use if using dl reasoners to classify individuals based on their subjects or another property used in its place is important approach  use classes directly as annotation property values another way to stay in owl dl is to use classes as values for annotation properties figure  this approach is very similar to approach  but it treats dcsubject as an annotation property dcsubject  a owlannotationproperty  lionslifeinthepridebook  a book   rdfsseealso httpisbnnu   booktitle lions life in the pride   dcsubject lion  figure  using classes as values for annotation properties considerations when choosing approach  in owl dl annotation properties cannot at the same time be defined either object properties or datatype properties thus if dcsubject or another property you want to use is defined elsewhere as an object property or a datatype property it cannot be used as an annotation property in owl dl annotation properties cannot have any restrictions such as cardinality or domainrange restrictions or subproperties thus if you use this approach you cannot specify that each book should have at least one subject for example or that individuals that are instances of bookaboutanimals must all be subclasses of the animal class even if the ontology is in owl dl ie the annotation properties are used consistent with owl dl restrictions dl reasoners will not use the information in annotation properties for reasoning thus in order to extract a book about lions when queried for animal books one would need to use specialpurpose reasoning that uses annotation properties and can perform reasoning with them owl code for approach  n rdfxml summary of approach  this approach allows you to use classes directly as property values while staying in owl dl however the properties that will have classes as values will have to be defined as annotations and therefore cannot have any additional restrictions defined on them and should not be declared as object or datatype properties elsewhere dl reasoners will not use values of annotation properties references n primer getting into rdf and semantic web
