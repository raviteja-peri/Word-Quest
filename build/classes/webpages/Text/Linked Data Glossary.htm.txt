warehouse is one approach to data integration in which data from various operational data systems is extracted cleaned transformed and copied to a centralized repository the centralized repository can then be used for data mining or answering analytical queries by contrast linked data assumes a distributed approach of data management using http uris to describe and access information resources a linked data approach is seen as an valid alternative to the centralized data warehouse approach especially when integrating datasets available on the public web  dbpedia dbpedia is a community effort to extract structured information from wikipedia and make it available on the web dbpedia is often depicted as a hub for the data cloud an rdf representation of the metadata held in wikipedia and made available for sparql query on the world wide web  dereferenceable uris when an http client can look up a uri using the http protocol and retrieve a description of the resource it is called a dereferenceable uri dereferenceable uris applies to uris that are used to identify classic html documents and uris that are used in the linked data context coolswuris to identify realworld objects and abstract concepts  description logic description logic dl is a family of knowledge representation languages with varying and adjustable expressivity dl is used in artificial intelligence for formal

to parse and generate jsonld is an appropriate linked data interchange language for javascript environments web service and nosql databases see also jsonld jsonld syntax   linked data a pattern for hyperlinking machinereadable data sets to each other using semantic web techniques especially via the use of rdf and uris enables distributed sparql queries of the data sets and a browsing or discovery approach to finding information as compared to a search strategy linked data is intended for access by both humans and machines linked data uses the rdf family of standards for data interchange eg rdfxml rdfa turtle and query sparql if linked data is published on the public web it is generally called linked open data see also linked data principles  linked data api a rest api that allows data publishers to provide urls to lists of things and clients to retrieve machinereadable data from those urls  linked data client a web client that supports http content negotiation for the retrieval of linked data from urls andor sparql endpoints a linked data client understands standard rest api for example the linked data rest api examples of linked data clients include tim

application integration the linked data platform describes the use of a rest api for accessing updating creating and deleting resources from servers see also ldpone  linked data principles provide a common api for data on the web which is more convenient than many separately and differently designed apis published by individual data suppliers tim bernerslee the inventor of the web and initiator of the linked data project proposed the following principles upon which linked data is based use uris to name things use http uris so that things can be referred to and looked up dereferenced by people and user agents when someone looks up a uri provide useful information using the open web standards such as rdf sparql include links to other related things using their uris when publishing on the web  linked open data linked data published on the public web and licensed under one of several open licenses permitting reuse publishing linked open data enables distributed sparql queries of the

formats that may be readily parsed by computer programs without access to proprietary libraries for example csv tsv and rdf formats are machine readable but pdf and microsoft excel are not creating and publishing data following linked data principles helps search engines and humans to find access and reuse data once information is found computer programs can reuse data without the need for custom scripts to manipulate the content publishing machine readable data using linked data principles provides a human and machine readable version for example wikipedia includes a web page about the color red dbpedia the database containing structured content contained in wikipedia allows a linked data client to look up red httpwikipediaorgwikired by changing wiki to data and appending the appropriate file extension  curl l httpdbpediaorgdataredttl  message the basic unit of http communication it consists of a structured sequence of octets matching the syntax defined as an http message and transmitted via the connection  metadata information used to administer describe preserve present use or link other information held in resources especially knowledge resources be they physical or

modeling process modeling process in the context of rdf refers to the act by subject matter experts to work with developers to capture the context of data and define the relationships of the data by doing so high quality of linked data is obtained since capturing organizational knowledge about the meaning of the data within the rdf data model means the data is more likely to be reused correctly well defined context ensures better understanding proper reuse and is critical when establishing linkages to other data sets  n n is an abbreviation for notation it has a readable rdf syntax used for
