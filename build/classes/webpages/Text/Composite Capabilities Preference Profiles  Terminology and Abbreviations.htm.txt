contents  terminology  abbreviations  references  terminology the key words must must not should should not may and may not in this document are to be interpreted as described in rfc  rfc the following terms are used in this document anonymization hiding the identity of the user as a security precaution assurance of origin information provided to the receiver of a message that allows it to be certain of the origin of the message this assurance may not be sufficient to convince any other party about the origin of the message assurance of receipt information provided to the sender of a message that allows it to be certain that the message was delivered to its intended recipient this is not necessarily a proof of receipt attributes a ccpp attribute refers to the data elements describing the profile and is denoted as an rdf property each ccpp attribute is associated with a value or a list of values or resources authentication some communication process that provides definite and tamperproof information about the identity of a communicating party authorization permission to view or modify a data resource or to perform some other action authorization is usually granted to an identified entity and thus depends on authentication of the party performing the action ccpp repository a server that stores the user agent profile or profile segments persistently in a form that may be referenced by and incorporated into a profile a ccpp repository is typically a web server that provides ccpp profiles or profile segments in response to http requests cacheable a data resource is said to be cacheable if the data resource contains a property that allows a sever to determine whether the cached resource matches a request for a similar resource cache a storage area used by a server or proxy to store data resources that have been retrieved or created in response to a request when a new request for a cached data resource is received the server or proxy can respond with the cached version instead of retrieving or creating a new copy capability an attribute of a sender or receiver often the receiver which indicates an ability to generate or process a particular type of message content see also attributes channel security a form of security authentication andor confidentiality that operates on a given communication channel regardless of the information that is transferred over that channel the security thus provided is between the endpoints of the channel only client an entity that is the original compositor of a ccpp profile confidentiality protecting the content of a message from unauthorized disclosure content generation for the purpose of this specification content generation refers to generating content appropriate to the user agent profile of the request by using the user agent profile as input to a dynamic content generation engine the xsl and style sheets of the document are used to tailor the document to the user agent profile of the request content negotiation the mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation when servicing a request the representation of entities in any response can be negotiated including error responses content selection for the purpose of this specification content selection refers to selecting an appropriate document from a list of possible choices or variants by matching the document profile with the user agent profile of the request content provider a server that originates content in response to a request data resource a data object that can be transferred across a network data resources may be available in multiple representations eg multiple languages data formats size resolutions or vary in other ways document for the purpose of this specification document refers to content supplied in response to a request using this definition a document may be a collection of smaller documents which in turn is a part of a greater document document profile document profiles offer a means to characterize the features appropriate to given categories of user agents for instance one profile might include support for style sheets vector graphics and scripting while another might be restricted to the tags in html  document profiles can be used by servers to select between document variants developed for different user agent categories they can be used to determine what transformations to apply when such variants are not available content developers can use document profiles to ensure that their web sites will be rendered as intended dynamic content content that is generated in response to a request this may be used for content that depends on changing environmental factors such as time eg stock quotes or place eg nearby gas stations feature functional property of a device or entity gateway software that is capable of bridging disparate network protocols for the purposes of this specification gateway refers to protocol bridging functionality which may exist in a standalone gateway or may be colocated with a proxy or origin server hint a suggestion or preference for a particular option while this option is strongly recommended its use is not required integrity procedures applied to ensure that information is not corrupted in transit different integrity procedures may protect against accidental or intentional corruption of data machine understandable data that is described with tags that associate a meaning to the data ie an author tag would describe the author of the document allowing data to be searched or combined and not just displayed namespace a qualifier added to an xml tag to ensure uniqueness among xml elements negotiate content message content that has been selected by content negotiation negotiation metadata information which is exchanged between the sender and the receiver of a message by content negotiation in order to determine the variant which should be transferred nonrepudiation this term has been the subject of much dispute broadly speaking it is a process that prevents a party to a communication from subsequently denying that the communication took place or from denying the content of the communication sometimes this term is used in a purely technical sense eg generation of data that is dependent on the communication and its content and sometimes in a legal sense ie evidence that could be sustained in a court of law nonrepudiation of origin the ability of the receiver to verify the source of the information nonrepudiation of receipt the ability of the sender to verify that the intended recipient received the information nonvariant content when the formformat of the content being sent does not depend on receivers capabilities andor preferences object security a form of security authentication andor confidentiality that operates on an item of data a object regardless of the communication channel over which it is passed object security can apply to data that is passed over several different data channels in succession but cannot be used to protect message addressing and other transferrelated information origin server software that can respond to requests by delivering appropriate content or error messages the origin server may receive requests via either wsp or http application programs executing on the origin server deliver content that is tailored in accordance with the ccpp that can be found within the provided profile for the purpose of this specification origin server refers to content generation capabilities which may physically exist in a standalone web server or may be colocated with a proxy or gateway preference an attribute of a sender or receiver often the receiver which indicates a preference to generate or process one particular type of message content over another even if both are possible privacy preventing the unintended or unauthorized disclosure of information about a person such information may be contained within a message but may also be inferred from patterns of communication eg when communications happen the types of resource accessed the parties withwhom communication occurs etc profile an instance of the schema that describe capabilities for a specific device and network a profile need not have all the attributes identified in the vocabularyschema proof of receipt or proof of delivery information provided to the sender of a message that allows them to prove subsequently to a third party that the message was delivered to its intended recipient this proof may not necessarily be legally sustainable proxy software that receives http requests and forwards that request toward the origin server possibly by way of an upstream proxy using http the proxy receives the response from the origin server and forwards it to the requesting client in providing its forwarding functions the proxy may modify either the request or response or provide other valueadded functions for the purposes of this specification proxy refers to requestresponse forwarding functionality which may exist in a standalone http proxy or may be colocated with a gateway or origin server rdf resource an object or element being described by rdf expressions is a resource an rdf resource is identified by a uri receiver a system component device or program which receives a message receiverinitiated transmission a message transmission which is requested by the eventual receiver of the message sometimes described as pull messaging eg an http get operation schema an rdf schema denotes resources which constitute the particular unchanging versions of an rdf vocabulary at any point in time it is used to provide semantic information such as organization and relationship about the interpretation of the statements in an rdf data model it does not include the values associated with the attributes security describes a set of procedures applied to data communications to ensure that information is transferred exactly as the sender and receiver intend and in no other way security generally breaks down into integrity authentication confidentiality and privacy sender a system component device or program which transmits a message senderinitiated transmission a message transmission which is invoked by the sender of the message sometimes described as push messaging eg sending an email user an individual or group of individuals acting as a single entity the user is further qualified as an entity who uses a device to request content andor resource from a server user agent a program such as a browser running on the device that acts on a users behalf users may use different user agents at different times user agent profile capabilities and preference information pertaining to the capabilities of the device the operating and network environment and users personal preferences for receiving content andor resource variant one of several possible representations of a data resource variant content when the formformat of the content being sent depends on receivers capabilities andor preferences vocabulary a collection of attributes that adequately describe the ccpp a vocabulary is associated
