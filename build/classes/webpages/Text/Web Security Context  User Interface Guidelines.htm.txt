current wc publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the wc technical reports index at httpwwwworgtr please see the working groups implementation report to frame its development of this specification the working group had previously published a use case note wscusecases this specification addresses most of the use cases and issues documented in that note by documenting best existing practice with the following exceptions this specification does not include advice for web site authors this specification does not provide advice to address the issue explained in sections  visually extending the chrome and  information bar aka notification bar additionally section  implementation and testing of wscusecases articulated an expectation that the recommendations in this specification would be subject to usability testing at least on a low fidelity level and that such testing would form part of the candidate recommendation exit criteria resources available to the working group at this point will not permit the group to conduct extensive usability testing at the same time the focus of this specification has shifted toward documenting best existing practice this document was developed by the web security context working group for a list of changes to this document since its proposed recommendation version please refer to the diff document all changes were editorial in nature please send comments about this document to publicusableauthentication@worg with public archive this document has been reviewed by wc members by software developers and by other wc groups and interested parties and is endorsed by the director as a wc recommendation it is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document wcs role in making the recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment this enhances the functionality and interoperability of the web this

deals with the trust decisions that users must make online and with ways to support them in making safe and informed decisions where possible in order to achieve that goal this specification includes recommendations on the presentation of identity information by user agents  identity signal we also include recommendations on conveying error situations in security protocols the error handling recommendations both minimize the trust decisions left to users and represent known best practice in inducing users toward safe behavior where they have to make these decisions to complement the interaction and decision related parts of this specification  robustness best practices addresses the question of how the communication of context information needed to make decisions can be made more robust against attacks this document specifies user interactions with a goal toward making security usable based on known best practice in this area this document is intended to provide user interface guidelines most sections assume the audience has a certain level of understanding of the core pki public key infrastructure technologies as used on the web the following sections are relevant to all readers and do not require a thorough understanding of pki  conformance  interaction and content model  indicators and interactions  error handling and signaling  robustness best practices and  warning fatigue since this document is part of the wc specification process it is written to clearly lay out the requirements and options for conforming to it as a standard user interface guidelines that are not intended for use as standards do not have such a structure readers more familiar with that latter form of user interface guideline are encouraged to read this specification as a way to avoid known mistakes in usable security this specification comes with two companion documents wscusecases documents the initial assumptions about the scope of this specification it also includes an initial set of use cases the working group discussed wscthreats documents the working groups initial threat analysis this document is based on current best practices in deployed user agents and covers the use cases and threats in those documents to that extent  acknowledgments this specification is based on text from mary ellen zurko stephen farrell anil saldhana ian fette michael mccormick serge egelman johnathan nightingale yngve n pettersen luis barriga hal lockhart tyler close bill doyle thomas roessler as well as input and discussions from the active members of the web security context working group primarily phillip hallambaker mike beltzner joe steele jan vidar krey maritza johnson rachna dhamija and dan schutzer it has also benefited from general public and working group commentary on earlier drafts  conformance  product classes this specification addresses web user agents as a product class web user agents and user agents are used synonymously in this specification this specification also addresses products that might incorporate changes to a user agents such as plugins extensions and others they are summarily called definition plugins in this section such products that might incorporate changes to the user agent eg through the addition or removal of features can render an otherwise conforming user agent non conforming or vice versa  language conventions throughout the specification the rfc  rfc keywords must must not should should not may are applied with their respective meanings  conformance levels a user agent conforms to this specification at the definition basic level if it honors all must and must not clauses of this specification a user agent conforms to this specification at the definition advanced level if it also honors all should and should not clauses of this specification conformance of a plugin is defined in terms of the conformance of the user agent that results when the plugin is added to a base user agent eg if a given user agent conforms to this specification on the basic level and a plugin adds features that lead to conformance on the advanced level then this plugin conforms on the advanced level with respect to this base user agent  conformance claims a claim about a web user agents conformance with this specification must state whether basic or advanced conformance is claimed see  conformance levels what tls sslvtlsvtlsv protocol versions and algorithms are considered as strong tls algorithms and what protocol versions and algorithms are supported in tls negotiation but not considered strong what user interface element is the tls indicator defined in this specification what user interface element is the identity signal defined in this specification what broadly accepted practices are considered sufficient for a trust anchor to be deemed augmented assurance qualified see  augmented assurance certificates and what data elements are deemed assured by those certificates what features beyond the claimed conformance level the user agent conforms with a claim about a plugins conformance with this specification must include all of the above and also identify the base user agent with respect to which conformance is claimed  interaction and content model  overview this specification assumes a human user interacting with a web user agent interacting with web resources many of the requirements specified are focused on the presentation of security context information to the user and therefore directly relate to user interfaces where requirements or techniques are specific to certain modalities these are made explicit and are part of the preconditions for applying the requirement or technique when this specification speaks of a web user agent to describe the application through which a user interacts with the web then this term is used on a conceptual level no assumption is made about implementation details the web user agent may denote a combination of several applications extensions to such applications operating system features and assistive technologies a common user agent will therefore be a web browser with some number of plugins extensions call outs to external systems which render particular document formats and assistive technologies this specification makes no specific assumption about the content with which the user interacts except for one there is a toplevel web page that is identified by a uri rfc this web page might be an html frameset an application running on top of a proprietary runtime environment or a document in a format interpreted by plugins or external systems served as part of a web interaction the pages behavior might be determined by scripting stylesheets or other mechanisms in interactive web applications the presentation to the user might also depend on state that is local to the client  be it local storage of structured data or be it recent interactions with the web page the security properties of those data will depend on the security properties of the client computer itself and are out of scope for this specification some requirements are expressed in terms of user interface components commonly found in currentgeneration web user agents  terms and definitions is expected to be consistent with the web content accessibility guidelines version  wcag  terms and definitions definition a web user agent is any software that retrieves and presents web content for users definition a web page is a resource that is referenced by a uri and is not embedded in another resource plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it  common user interface elements this section defines terms for user interface elements commonly present in web user agents definition primary user interface denotes the portions of a web user agents user interface that are available to users without being solicited by a user interaction examples of primary user interface include the location bar in common web user agents the padlock icon present in common web user agents or error pages that take the place of a web page that could not be retrieved definition secondary user interface denotes the portions of a web user agents user interface that are available to the user after they are solicited by a specific user interaction examples of secondary user interface include the page information dialog commonly found in web user agents and the security properties dialog that can obtained by clicking the padlock icon in common web user agents we occasionally use the term definition chrome to refer to the representation through which the user interacts with the user agent itself as distinct from the accessed web content this includes both primary and secondary user interface definition location bar is a widget in a web user agents user interface which displays and often allows input of the textual location entered as a uri of the resource being requested or displayed  after the response is received definition identity information is information about the web site which is used to present the identity signal  applying tls to the web  certificate handling and information public key certificates see pkix are widely used in tls sslv tlsv tlsv but have been the basis for the generation of many inappropriate warnings and other dialogs for users this section describes some modifications to current certificate processing aimed at improving this aspect of handling web security context and defines some new terms describing various cases related to certificate handling in user agents user agents can base their acceptance of certificates that are presented by web servers on various sources including user action previous interactions involving the same certificate or as more traditionally assumed on validation of a certificate chain where each certificate is issued by a certification authority ca the practices used by cas and the information attested vary by ca and are not available in any useful sense to web user agents  interactively accepting trust anchors or certificates a trust anchor represents an authoritative entity represented by a public key and associated data the public key is used to verify digital signatures and the associated data is used to constrain the types of information for which the trust anchor is authoritative relying parties use trust anchors to determine if digitally signed information objects are valid by verifying digital signatures using the trust anchors public key and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the associated certificate data trust anchor installation is typically handled by user agent vendors systems administrators and device manufacturers based on outofband information note that updating trust anchors is therefore often handled as part of user agent or operating system software updates however current user agents sometimes support the interactive acceptance of a trust anchor during a session based on user interaction most users cannot sensibly decide how to handle such interactions similarly endentity eg web server certificates that cannot be currently verified using the basic path validation algorithm may trigger current user agents to offer the user a choice to accept the certificate in any case sometimes for a single session sometimes for all future sessions involving that certificate possibly scoped to specific host and port combinations definition a trust anchor or certificate is interactively accepted if the acceptance was caused through a user interaction that happens while the user is focused on a primary task unrelated to trust and certificate management for example if a web server certificate is presented for acceptance by a user during ordinary web interactions and is accepted by the user then this matches the test for interactive acceptance if however a systems administrator or user adds a trust anchors certificate to an agents store of trust roots then that certificate is not considered interactively accepted  augmented assurance certificates some trust anchors adhere to documented broadly accepted practices eg evtlscert these involve some level of guarantee that certificates chaining up to those roots embody augmented assurance and can therefore be treated more favorably in terms of the primary security indicators we call such certificates augmented assurance certificates definition an augmented assurance certificate is a public key certificate where the issuer asserts that the subject entity has been authenticated by means of some process that adheres to the requirements of an augmented assurance specification supported by the user agent the certificate chain for such a certificate must be validated up to a trust root that is recognized as augmented assurance qualified by the user agent this specification does not define what an augmented assurance qualified trust root is except to note that this designation is made by user agents through an out of band mechanism consistent with the relevant underlying augmented assurance specification marking a trust anchor as augmented assurance qualified is a securitycritical step and most often will involve the use of some applicationspecific outofband mechanism implementations must not enable users to designate trust roots as augmented assurance qualified as part of a unrelated interaction in particular the notions of an augmented assurance qualified trust root and an interactively accepted trust root are mutually exclusive in addition to the out of band designation process described above the trust anchor and possibly all certificates in a path chaining up to such a trust anchor may need to be specially marked eg through the use of specific policy object identifiers the specific marking mechanisms to be used and the special treatment to be afforded to such certificates are out of scope of this document but will typically be covered by the underlying augmented assurance specification user agent implementers determine the set of such standards that they support and the associated special treatment to apply other than as outlined below where we impose some consistency requirements on the handling of this type of certificate to derive a humanreadable subject name from an augmented assurance certificate user agents should use the subject fields organization o and country c attributes they must use information that is subject to the certificate authoritys additional assurances as documented in the user agents conformance statement note should certificates arise in the future that provide strong assurance of the holders identity but do not include an organization attribute then user agents can make use of the additional assurance level and identity information without violating this specification such future certificates could for example include high assurance certificates for individuals  validated certificates the term definition validated certificate  is used to denote a public key certificate that has been verified by chaining up to a locally configured trust anchor the set of trust anchors used by a given web user agent is implementationdependent since augmented assurance certificates chain up to a special trust anchor all valid augmented assurance certificates are also validated certificates certificates or certificate chains that are pinned to a particular destination are not considered validated certificates by virtue of being pinned the notion of a validated certificate in this specification corresponds to the domain validated certificate commonly deployed on the web this type of certificate attests to a binding between a domain name registration and a key pair additional certificate attributes are often not validated  selfsigned certificates and untrusted root certificates selfsigned certificates ssc which are not trust anchors by themselves are commonly used for appliances and web sites catering to small groups of users and essentially serve as a container for cryptographic key material in a key exchange that is not verified by any third party certificate chains that lead up to custom root certificates which are not part of the user agents store of trust roots are sometimes used similarly in both situations use of tls provides confidentiality protection services against passive attackers no binding of a thirdparty asserted identity to the cryptographic key is achieved in both cases the certificates are not considered validated certificates using key continuity management kcm user agents can use selfsigned certificates or certificates that chain up to an untrusted root to determine that they are consistently communicating with the same end entity thereby defending against active attacks as well simply put if a web site consistently presents the same selfsigned certificate or the same certificate chaining up to the same untrusted root to a client then this can be strong evidence that protection against an active attacker has been achieved as well conversely a change of certificates for the same site can be evidence that a man in the middle attack occurs  or it can merely indicate that the legitimate site has changed to a different certificate user agents may support definition pinning a selfsigned certificate or more generally a certificate chain that leads to an untrusted root certificate to a particular web site to enable behavior based on recorded state about certificates shown previously by the same site such behavior includes eg warning users about changes of certificates and not showing warning messages if a site shows a certificate consistent with previous visits the interaction that enables users to pin a certificate to a destination should not cause a selfsigned certificate to be pinned to more than one site identified through uri scheme domain and port the interaction must not cause an untrusted root certificate to be accepted automatically for additional sites  types of tls the most common mechanism for applying tls to the web is the use of the https uri scheme rfc the alternative upgrade mechanism rfc is used rarely if at all for the purposes of this specification the most relevant property of rfc is that the uri used to identify a resource includes an assertion that use of tls is desired this specification uses the term definition http transaction  regardless of whether any kind of tls protection was applied in particular the transactions arising when an https uri is dereferenced are subsumed under this term rfc definition an http transaction is tlsprotected if the resource was identified through a uri with the https uri scheme the tls handshake was performed successfully and the http transaction has occurred through the tls channel note that an http transaction may be considered tls protected even though weak algorithms including null encryption are negotiated definition an http transaction is strongly tlsprotected if it is tlsprotected an https url was used strong tls algorithms were negotiated for both confidentiality and integrity protection and at least one of the following conditions is true the server used a validated certificate that matches the dereferenced uri or the server used a selfsigned certificate that was pinned to the destination or the server used a certificate chain leading to an untrusted root certificate that was pinned to the destination tls modes that do not require the server to show a certificate such as the dh_anon mode do not lead to a strongly tlsprotected transaction the ability to provide privacy and secure the connection between a user agent and web server is in part determined by the strength and capabilities of the tls protocol and underlying cryptographic mechanisms the tls protocol is versioned to keep pace with protocol features and cipher suites that are available cipher suites are grouped according to algorithms and the key length used by cryptographic functions to provide cipher strength when this document speaks of definition strong tls algorithms then the following must hold no version of the tls protocol that suffers known security flaws has been negotiated at the point of writing of this document versions of ssl prior to sslv sslv must not be considered strong a cipher suite has been selected for which key and algorithm strengths correspond to industry practice at the time of writing of this document the export cipher suites explicitly forbidden in appendix a of tlsv must not be considered strong what set of algorithms is considered as strong by a given implementation must be described in any conformance claim against this specification see  conformance claims definition an http transaction is weakly tlsprotected if it is tlsprotected but strong tls protection could not be achieved for one of the following reasons tls handshake used an anonymous key exchange algorithm such as dh_anon the cryptographic algorithms negotiated are not considered strong certificates were used that are not either validated certificates or selfsigned certificates pinned to the destination see  selfsigned certificates and untrusted root certificates weakly tlsprotected interactions may provide security services such as confidentiality protection against passive attackers or integrity protection against active attackers without confidentiality protection these properties are often desirable even if strong tls protection cannot be achieved  mixed content if a given web page consists of a single resource only then all content that the user interacts with has security properties derived from the http transaction used to retrieve the content definition a web page is called tlssecured if the toplevel resource and all other resources that can affect or control the pages content and presentation have been retrieved through strongly tls protected http transactions  definition a web page is called mixed content if the toplevel resource was retrieved through a strongly tls protected http transaction but some dependent resources were retrieved through a weakly protected or unprotected http transaction this definition implies that inline images stylesheets script content and frame content for a secure page need to be retrieved through strongly tls protected http transactions in order for the overall page to be considered tlssecured any ui indicator used to signal the presence of augmented assurance certificates must not signal the presence of such a certificate unless the page is tlssecured ie all parts of the page are loaded from servers presenting at least a validated certificate over strongly tlsprotected interactions for relevant security considerations see  mixing augmented assurance and validated certificates  error conditions  tls errors this section covers tlsrelated error conditions and maps them to the classes of error handling interactions see  error handling and signaling that are used when these conditions arise if multiple error conditions apply the most severe signaling level currently known must be used as defined in  error handling and signaling when during tls negotiation the certificate chain presented by the server does not lead to a trusted root certificate and the certificate chain presented was not pinned to the destination the following applies error signaling of class warning or higher  warningcaution messages   danger messages must be used to signal the error condition user agents may offer a possibility to pin newly encountered certificates to the destination note that when untrusted certificates are accepted without user interaction an additional exposure to maninthemiddle attacks is created see  active attacks during initial tls interactions for a more detailed discussion of this scenario when certificate information is presented in the interactions described in this section then humanreadable information from certificates must not be presented as trustworthy unless it is attested eg a selfsigned certificates common name or organization attribute must not be displayed even if that certificate is pinned to a destination user agents may display this information in a dialog or other secondary user interfaces reachable from the warning or error messages specified here when during tls negotiation the endentity certificate presented or one of the intermediate certificates in the certificate chain are found to have been revoked error signaling of class danger  danger messages must be used when during tls negotiation the endentity certificate presented or one of the intermediate certificates in the certificate chain are found to have expired error signaling of class danger  danger messages must be used when the uri corresponding to the transaction does not match the endentity certificate presented and a validated certificate is used then error signaling of level danger  danger messages must be used if tls negotiation otherwise fails error signaling of level danger  danger messages must be used when tls error conditions occur user agents may choose to abort the connection without any further user interaction the guidelines in this section apply when user agents choose to cause a user interaction in the case of tls error conditions note that user agents may combine both practices eg an interactive approach may be chosen for the toplevel frame of a web page but a noninteractive approach may be chosen for inline content it is expected that the xmlhttprequest specification xhr will include a noninteractive approach as well  error conditions based on third party or heuristic information user agents that use third party services or heuristic approaches to assess the possible danger of a pending web transaction must use error signaling of class danger  danger messages to signal positively identified dangers eg identified malicious downloads or exploits of user agent vulnerabilities to signal risks that are identified with high likelihood but involve further user decisions eg phishing heuristics were triggered error signaling of class warning or above  warningcaution messages   danger messages must be used  insecure form submission users interacting with a tlssecured page are likely to develop the impression that information submitted during these interactions will be strongly tlsprotected user agents may warn users using an error of class warning or higher  warningcaution messages   danger messages if form submissions from a tlssecured page are directed to an unsecured channel  indicators and interactions  identity and trust anchor signaling this section specifies practices for signaling information about the identity of the web site a user interacts with all signals specified in this section are passive no claim is made about the effectiveness of these signals to counter impersonation attacks  identity signal user agents must make information about the identity of the web site that a user interacts with available this definition identity signal  should be part of primary user interface during usage modes which entail the presence of signaling to the user beyond only presenting page content otherwise it must be available through secondary user interface note that there may be usage modes during which this requirement does not apply for example a web agent which is interactively switched into a presentation mode that does not display any chrome need not preserve security indicators in primary user interface on the other hand a user agent such as a smart phone individual entertainment screen in an airplane seat back or tv set which has a usage mode that makes minimal but visible chrome elements available does need to preserve security indicators in such a mode user agents with a visual user interface must show the identity signal in a consistent visual position web content must not obscure security user interface  obscuring or disabling security user interfaces  identity signal content information displayed in the identity signal must be derived from validated certificates or from user agent state web user agents must not use information as part of the identity signal that is taken from unauthenticated or untrusted sources during interactions with a tlssecured web page for which the toplevel resource has been retrieved through a strongly tlsprotected interaction that involves an augmented assurance certificate and for which all dependent resources have been retrieved through interactions that involve validated certificates the following applies the identity signal must include humanreadable information about the certificate subject derived as specified in  augmented assurance certificates to inform the user about the owner of the web page during interactions with a tlssecured web page for which the toplevel resource has been retrieved through a strongly tlsprotected interaction that involves a validated certificate including an augmented assurance certificate the following applies if the identity signal does not include any other human readable information about the identity of the certificate subject derived eg from an augmented assurance certificate then it must include an applicable dns name that matches either the subjects common name attribute or its subjectaltname extension user agents may shorten such a dns name by displaying only a suffix to inform the user about the party responsible for that information the issuer fields organization attribute must be displayed in the identity signal or in secondary user interface that is available through a consistent interaction with the identity signal subject logotypes rfc derived from certificates must not be rendered unless the certificate used is an augmented assurance certificate note that this behavior does not apply when selfsigned certificates or certificate chains that chain up to an untrusted root certificate are used during interactions with a mixed content web page the identity signal must not include any site identity information beyond that which is in use for unprotected http transactions in this situation the identity signal may include indicators that point out any error conditions that occurred during interactions with mixed content user agents must not render any logotypes rfc derived from certificates  additional security context information this section describes additional security context information provided by web user agents where security context information is provided in both primary and secondary interface the meaning of the presented information must be consistent best practice will also avoid inconsistent presentation such as using identical or semantically similar icons for different information in different places the information sources must make the following security context information available the web pages domain name owner information consistent with section  identity signal content verifier information consistent with section  identity signal content the reason why the displayed information is trusted or not this includes whether or not a certificate was accepted interactively whether a selfsigned certificate was used and whether the selfsigned certificate was pinned to the site that the user interacts with and whether trust relevant settings of the user agent were otherwise overridden through user action the information sources should make the following security context information available an explanation of the information represented by the tls indicator eg concerning the presence mixed content if the web page is weakly tlsprotected then what conditions cause the protection to be weak eg bad algorithms mixed content  whether the user has visited the site in the past whether the user has stored credentials for this site whether the site content was encrypted in transmission whether the site content was authenticated eg server authentication via tls additionally the information sources may make the following security context information available when the user first visited the site in the past how often the user visited the site in the past user agents that provide information about the presence or absence of cookies rfc must not make any claims that suggest that the absence of cookies implies an absence of any user tracking as there are numerous tracking and session management techniques that do not rely on cookies  tls indicator user agents must make information about the state of tls protection available the definition tls indicator should be part of primary user interface during usage modes which entail the presence of signaling to the user beyond only presenting page content otherwise it must be available through secondary user interface as in the case of  identity signal there may be usage modes during which this requirement does not apply web content must not obscure security interface see  obscuring or disabling security user interfaces user agents with a visual user interface should make the tls indicator available in a consistent visual position the tls indicator must present a distinct state that is used only for tlssecured web pages the user agent should inform users when they are viewing a page that along with all dependent resources was retrieved through at least weakly tls protected transactions including mixed content the user agent may accomplish this by using a third state in the tls indicator or via another mechanism such as a dialog info bar or other means  error handling and signaling this section defines common error interaction requirements and ordered by increasing severity practices to signal the following classes of errors  warningcaution messages  danger messages user agents may communicate additional indicators to users eg a user agent could additionally display a persistent indicator in a danger situation for additional security considerations concerning frequent warning messages see  warning fatigue  common error interaction requirements error signaling that occurs as part of primary user interface should be phrased in terms of threat to users interests not technical occurrence primary user interface error messages must not be phrased solely in terms of art for example if a certificate includes a dns name in the subjectaltname extension that does not match the uri of the site that the user tries to visit an error message can explain that the user is reaching a different site instead of reporting a subjectaltname mismatch they should not tell the user to enter the destination site that caused the error eg to provide feedback or obtain assistance for error messages that interrupt the users flow of interaction user agents should enable the user to easily return to the page that the user was previously interacting with note that this ideally implies returning to the previous user agent state  including the results of user input and dynamic processing  however this may not be feasible under all circumstances for advanced users error interactions should have an option to request a detailed description of the condition that caused the error interaction to occur the error interactions discussed in this section typically involve communication of security context information  warningcaution messages warning  caution messages are intended for situations when the system has good reason to believe that the user may be at risk based on the current security context information but a determination cannot positively be made warning  caution messages must interrupt the users current task such that the user has to acknowledge the message warning  caution messages must provide the user with distinct options for how to proceed ie these messages must not lead to a situation in which the only option presented to the user is to dismiss the warning and continue the options presented on these warnings must be descriptive to the point that their respective meaning can be understood in the absence of any other information contained in the warning interaction one of the options offered should be recommended and the warning message should include a succinct text component denoting which option is recommended in the absence of a recommended option the warning must present the user with a method of finding out more information eg a hyperlink secondary window etc if the options cannot be understood  danger messages danger messages are intended for situations when there is a positively identified danger to the user ie not merely a risk the interactions communicating these messages must be designed such that the users task is interrupted these interactions must be presented in a way that makes it impossible for the user to go to or interact with the destination web site that caused the danger situation to occur without first explicitly interacting with the danger message  robustness best practices  keep security chrome visible for visual user agents agent chrome should always be present to signal security context information this requirement does not apply when user interface is explicitly dismissed by the user  do not mix content and security indicators to the extent to which users pay attention to passive security indicators at all noticing and understanding them is made difficult to impossible when the same signal path that is commonly used for security indicators can also be controlled by web content for example the location bar commonly found on agents is often used to both display the padlock security indicator and a possible favorite icon favicon which can in turn be a simple copy of the very padlock an informed and attentive user might look for web user agents must not communicate positive trust information using user interface elements which can be mimicked within chrome under the control of web content sitecontrolled content eg page title favicon may be hosted in chrome but this content must not be displayed in a manner that confuses hosted content and chrome indicators by allowing that content to mimic chrome indicators in a position close to them this requirement applies to both primary and secondary elements of visual user interfaces in particular web user agents should not use a x image in chrome to indicate security status if doing so would allow the favorite icon to mimic it  managing user attention when confronted with multiple modal interactions during a short amount of time users are known to exercise the default option eg by pressing the enter key repeatedly until the sequence of modal interactions stops blocking the users intended interaction definition an interaction flooding attack refers to a web site with the malicious intent of performing an unintended action eg installing software that would have required an user intervention such as clicking ok on a warning dialog or by exploiting distraction and taskfocus the web site opens a large number of new windows over the desired web content and the malicious action is performed when the user tries to close these new windows andor clicks on a dialog that indicates a trust decision  user interfaces used to inform users about security critical events or to solicit input must employ techniques that prevent immediate dismissal of the user interface eg by using a temporarily disabled ok button on user interfaces that make such an interaction paradigm available when users interact with security relevant notifications  warningcaution messages and above web content must not be granted control of the user agents interaction a web user agent should not display a modal security dialog related to a web page which does not currently have focus security dialogs include prompts for user credentials script errors and tls errors  apis exposed to web content user agents commonly allow web content to perform certain manipulations of agent ui and functionality such as opening new windows resizing existing windows etc to permit customization of the user experience these manipulations need to be constrained to prevent malicious sites from concealing or obscuring important elements of the agent interface or deceiving the user into performing dangerous acts this section includes requirements and techniques to address known attacks of this kind  obscuring or disabling security user interfaces web user agents must prevent web content from obscuring hiding or disabling user interfaces that display security context information except in response to a user interaction user agents must restrict window sizing and moving operations consistent with section  keep security chrome visible this prevents attacks wherein agent chrome is obscured by moving it off the edges of the visible screen user agents must not allow web content to open new windows with the agents security ui hidden allowing this operation facilitates pictureinpicture attacks where artificial chrome usually indicating a positive security state is supplied by the web content in place of the hidden ui user agents must prevent web content from overlaying chrome this helps to ensure that user interactions that are perceived to target agent chrome are not redirected to web applications  software installation this section covers web user agent apis that allow web content to download software for later execution outside of the web user agent context web user agents must not expose programming interfaces which permit installation of software without a user intervention user agents must inform the user and request consent when the user agent is attempting to install software outside of the agent environment as a result of web content the interaction used must follow the requirements in  warningcaution messages  user agents should not provide features which can be used by web content to install software outside of the agent environment without the users consent  bookmarking apis user agents often include features that enable web content to update the users bookmarks eg through an ecmascript api if permitted unchecked these features can serve to confuse users by eg placing a bookmark that goes by the same name as the users bank but points to an attackers site web user agents must not permit web content to add bookmarks without explicit user consent web user agents must not permit web content to add uris to the users bookmark collection that do not match the uri of the page that the user currently interacts with  popup window apis with visual user interfaces that use a windowed interaction paradigm user agents should restrict the opening of popup windows from web content particularly those not initiated by user action creating excessive numbers of new popup windows is a technique that can be used to condition users to rapidly dismissing dialogs this can be employed in interaction flooding attacks user agents which offer this restriction should offer a way to extend permission to individual trusted sites failing to do so encourages users who desire the functionality on certain sites to disable the feature universally  security considerations  active attacks during initial tls interactions section  tls errors leads to additional exposure during the first tls interaction with a site even if that site uses validated or extended validation certificates an active attacker can show a selfsigned certificate which will cause only weak warning signals to the user traditional user agents react to this scenario with a dialog box that interrupts the users flow of interaction but gives users the ability to override the security warning empirical evidence shows that this ability is typically exercised by users countermeasures against this threat include the prior designation of highvalue sites for which extended validation or validated certificates are required causing a stronger warning signal during the attack scenario described above and communication of certification and tls expectations by a mechanism separate from http eg through authenticated dns records  tls errors refers to the pinning of a new certificate to a destination note that this newly pinned certificate could be the basis for a spoofing attack or it could represent a refresh of an self signed certificate  certificate status checking failures the tls errors  tls errors section does not document intended behavior for user agents when a certificate status check fails for network or other nonrevocation reasons at time of writing the deployment environment for ocsp rfc status checking is fragile and subject to frequent failures so it is inappropriate to require that user agents treat such failures as warnings or errors however this creates a possibility for attack site operators using a fraudulently obtained and revoked certificate may attempt to attack a cas revocation infrastructure as a way to suppress revocation errors user agent countermeasures for this vulnerability include exposing failures of certificate validation checks to users as warning  warningcaution messages  or danger  danger messages level messages or refusal to load sites that fail these checks  certificates assure identity not security while tls certificates of all types ie selfsigned validated or augmented assurance provide the means for strong encryption of communications they should not be understood to be or treated as blanket security assurances in particular validated and augmented assurance certificates make guarantees about some level of owner identity verification having been performed see definitions but they do not represent any guarantees that a site is operated in a safe manner or is not otherwise subject to attack historically issues of security and identity have been conflated by user agent interfaces which present ssltls connections as secure but implementers of this specification are advised to be cautious and cognizant of this distinction  binding human readable names to domain names several recommendations in this document concern themselves with the binding between domain names and certificates but equally important for users is the binding between domain namecertificate and the actual realworld entity involved in the transaction it is helpful for example to know not only that examplecom presents a valid certificate but also that it is the example inc norway with whom the user expects to be interacting in the case of augmented assurance certificates the identity information provided may be considered sufficient for this purpose but other validated certificates do not necessarily provide this realworld identity user agents that wish to provide a mechanism for users to manually establish these linkages are advised to consider the petnames approach see petnames  warning fatigue requirements in this document often involve warning  warningcaution messages and  danger messages messages when warranted by conditions in the user agent however it is important to be aware when developing user interfaces that users will habituate to overfrequent warnings weakening the impact of the messages and their ability to effectively interrupt the users task flow user agents are advised to constrain the number of warnings and errors presented to the minimum required to satisfy these and other security guidelines it is also recommended that user agents phrase options in these messages in terms of the action taken eg ignore this warning trust this site rather than using generic labels eg ok cancel  mixing augmented assurance and validated certificates the augmented assurance indicator tells the user that the owner and author of the web page being displayed can be identified using information from the associated augmented assurance certificate identity signals in this specification only directly address displaying the identity of the party responsible for the top level resource in a web page user agents may choose to make the identities of other resources that can affect or control the pages content available but we do not put forward a model for users on how they might use such information in their trust decisions the identity of the top level resource vouches for the content of all dependent resources what resources these are is under the control of the toplevel resource which will typically identify these resources using uris with domain based authority therefore this specification requires that in order to display any augmented assurance related indicators dependent resources must all be strongly tls protected using validated certificates if an augmented assurance page includes content from other strongly tlsprotected resources that are not identified by augmented assurance certificates the authors for these third party parts of the document cannot be identified to the same extent as for the main document given that certain types of content for example external scripts and styling can change the containing documents entire appearance and framed content and plugins can be where the users main interaction occurs the users real interaction may be with content under the control of a completely different party than the one identified by the main documents augmented assurance certificate using third party content also makes the main document reliant upon the security of the third party contributor and expands the available attack surface of the service thus giving attackers several more lines of attack under the agents same origin policy separately displayed web pages from the same origin can freely read and modify each others state a web pages origin is comprised of the scheme host and port of the uri used to retrieve the web page the origin does not take into account any attributes of the tls session or server certificate used when retrieving a web page for example consider a user agent that has loaded two web pages from httpswwwexamplecom when the first page was retrieved an augmented assurance certificate was used by the tls session when the second page was retrieved a different certificate such as a domain validated or selfsigned certificate was used though the first page was retrieved using an augmented assurance certificate the second page can freely read and write the first page differing security presentations of the two pages may obscure this relationship in the mind of the user  dynamic content might change security properties this specification is expressed in terms of the fundamentally static indicators of existing agent security user interfaces these indicators tend to assume that the security properties of a page will not change in a significant way once it has finished loading whatever that might mean in detail strictly speaking this assumption is flawed dynamic pages can load scripts and data at any time and from any source using techniques like the insertion of script tags into the dom at run time the effect may very well be that a page that was retrieved from a secure web site with an augmented assurance certificate could at some point be under the control of scripts that are retrieved insecurely this specification does not prescribe any specific user interaction in this kind of situation for tlsprotected http requests caused using the xmlhttprequest api xhr xhr this specification permits either handling the error situation described above as a network error and leaving behavior to the web application in question or causing a user interaction it is expected that upcoming specifications for the xmlhttprequest api will opt for the former choice  terms defined in this document advanced level augmented assurance certificate basic level chrome http
