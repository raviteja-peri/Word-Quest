web applications different use cases for graphics demand different solutions thus there are several different technologies available photographs are best represented with png while interactive line art data visualization and even user interfaces need the power of svg and the canvas api css exists to enhance other formats like html or svg webcgm meets the needs for technical illustration and documentation in many industries what is png portable network graphics png is a static file format for the lossless portable wellcompressed storage and exchange of raster images bitmaps it features rich color control with indexedcolor grayscale and truecolor support and alphachannel transparency png is designed for the web with streaming and progressive rendering capabilities it is supported

scriptable dom as well as declarative animation via the smil specification it supports a wide range of visual features such as gradients opacity filters clipping and masking the use of svg allows fully scalable smooth reusable graphics from simple graphics to enhance html pages to fully interactive chart and data visualization to games to standalone highquality static images svg is natively

modern browsers with script libraries extending support to all major browsers and even on some mobile devices what is webcgm web computer graphics metafile webcgm is the web profile of cgm the iso standard for vector and composite vectorraster picture definition cgm has a significant following in technical illustration interactive electronic documentation geophysical data visualization amongst other application areas and is widely used in the fields of automotive engineering aeronautics and the defense industry webcgm has many of the same graphical features as svg examples as a simple
