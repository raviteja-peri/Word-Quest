d sample relax ng grammar nonnormative e changes from xlink  nonnormative  introduction this specification defines the xml linking language xlink which allows elements to be inserted into xml documents in order to create and describe links between resources xlink provides a framework for creating both basic unidirectional links and more complex linking structures it allows xml documents to assert linking relationships among more than two resources associate metadata with a link express links that reside in a location separate from the linked resources an important application of xlink is in hypermedia systems that have hyperlinks a simple case of a hyperlink is an html a element which has these characteristics the hyperlink uses iris as its locator technology the hyperlink is expressed at one of its two ends the hyperlink identifies the other end although a server may have great freedom in finding or dynamically creating that destination users can initiate traversal only from the end where the hyperlink is expressed to the other end the hyperlinks effect on windows frames goback lists style sheets in use and so on is determined by user agents not by the hyperlink itself for example traversal of a links normally replaces the current view perhaps with a user option to open a new window this set of characteristics is powerful but the model that underlies them limits the range of possible hyperlink functionality the model defined in this specification shares with html the use of iri technology but goes beyond html in offering features previously available only in dedicated hypermedia systems that make hyperlinking more scalable and flexible along with providing linking data structures xlink provides a minimal link behavior model higherlevel applications layered on xlink will often specify alternate or more sophisticated rendering and processing treatments integrated treatment of specialized links used in other technical domains such as foreign keys in relational databases and reference values in programming languages is outside the scope of this specification for languages such as css that wish to identify hypertext links in a document we suggest that any local element from which xlink specifies that traversal is possible and which the application treats as if it specified actuateonrequest be treated as a hyperlink source anchor  origin and goals the design of xlink has been informed by knowledge of established hypermedia systems and standards the following standards have been especially influential html html defines several element types that represent links hytime isoiec  defines inline and inbound and thirdparty link structures and some semantic features including traversal control and presentation of objects text encoding initiative guidelines tei provides structures for creating links aggregate objects and link collections many other linking systems have also informed the design of xlink especially dexter fress ohs microcosm and intermedia see the xlink requirements document xlreq for a thorough explanation of requirements for the design of xlink  xlink concepts this section describes the terms and concepts that are essential to understanding xlink without discussing the syntax used to create xlink constructs a few additional terms are introduced in later parts of this specification  links and resources definition an xlink link is an explicit relationship between resources or portions of resources definition it is made explicit by an xlink linking element which is an xlinkconforming xml element that asserts the existence of a link there are six xlink elements only two of them are considered linking elements the others provide various pieces of information that describe the characteristics of a link the term link as used in this specification refers only to an xlink link though nothing prevents nonxlink constructs from serving as links the notion of resources is universal to the world wide web definition as discussed in rfc  a resource is any addressable unit of information or service examples include files images documents programs and query results the means used for addressing a resource is a iri internationalized resource identifier reference described more in  locator attribute href it is possible to address a portion of a resource for example if the whole resource is an xml document a useful portion of that resource might be a particular element inside the document following a link to it might result for example in highlighting that element or scrolling to that point in the document definition when a link associates a set of resources those resources are said to participate in the link even though xlink links must appear in xml documents they are able to associate all kinds of resources not just xmlencoded ones one of the common uses of xlink is to create hyperlinks definition a hyperlink is a link that is intended primarily for presentation to a human user nothing in xlinks design however prevents it from being used with links that are intended solely for consumption by computers  arcs traversal and behavior definition using or following a link for any purpose is called traversal even though some kinds of link can associate arbitrary numbers of resources traversal always involves a pair of resources or portions of them definition the source from which traversal is begun is the starting resource and definition the destination is the ending resource note that the term resource used in this fashion may at times apply to a resource portion not a whole resource definition information about how to traverse a pair of resources including the direction of traversal and possibly application behavior information as well is called an arc if two arcs in a link specify the same pair of resources but they switch places as starting and ending resources then the link is multidirectional which is not the same as merely going back after traversing a link  resources in relation to the physical location of a linking element definition a local resource is an xml element that participates in a link by virtue of having as its parent or being itself a linking element definition any resource or resource portion that participates in a link by virtue of being addressed with an iri reference is considered a remote resource even if it is in the same xml document as the link or even inside the same linking element put another way a local resource is specified by value and a remote resource is specified by reference definition an arc that has a local starting resource and a remote ending resource goes outbound that is away from the linking element examples of links with such an arc are the html a element hytime clinks and text encoding initiative xref elements definition if an arcs ending resource is local but its starting resource is remote then the arc goes inbound definition if neither the starting resource nor the ending resource is local then the arc is a thirdparty arc though it is not required any one link typically specifies only one kind of arc throughout and thus might be referred to as an inbound outbound or thirdparty link to create a link that emanates from a resource to which you do not have or choose not to exercise write access or from a resource that offers no way to embed linking constructs it is necessary to use an inbound or thirdparty arc when such arcs are used the requirements for discovery of the link are greater than for outbound arcs definition documents containing collections of inbound and thirdparty links are called link databases or linkbases  xlink processing and conformance this section details processing and conformance requirements on xlink applications and markup definition the key words must must not required shall shall not should should not recommended may and optional in this specification are to be interpreted as described in rfc   processing dependencies xlink processing depends on xml xml names xml base rfc  and charmod fundamentals  markup conformance an xml element conforms to xlink if it has a type attribute from the xlink namespace whose value is one of simple extended locator arc resource title or none and it adheres to the conformance constraints imposed by the chosen xlink element type as prescribed in this specification or it does not have a type attribute from the xlink namespace and it adheres to the conformance constraints imposed by the xlink simple element type as prescribed in this specification it does not have any attributes in the xlink namespace other than type href role arcrole title show actuate label from and to content conforming to xlink must conform to charmod fundamentals this specification imposes no particular constraints on schemas conformance applies only to elements and attributes  application conformance an xlink application is any software module that interprets wellformed xml documents containing xlink elements and attributes or xml information sets xis containing information items and properties corresponding to xlink elements and attributes this document refers to elements and attributes but all specifications herein apply to their information set equivalents as well xlink defines two conformance levels for an xlink application simple and full  full conformance an application satisfies the constraints of full conformance if it observes the mandatory conditions must for applications set forth in this specification and for any recommended or optional conditions should and may it chooses to observe it observes them in the way prescribed and it performs markup conformance testing according to all the conformance constraints appearing in this specification it applies xlink semantics only to those elements which satisfy the markup conformance criteria outlined in  markup conformance applications implementing xlink must conform to charmod fundamentals  simple conformance an application satisfies the constraints of simple conformance if it is fully conformant with respect to simple links in other words the processor may ignore any link which specifies an xlinktype other than simple if the xlinkhref attribute is specified and the xlinktype attribute is not specified the element must be processed as if xlinktype specified simple an application which claims simple conformance may ignore all other xlink elements  xlink markup design this section describes the design of xlinks markup vocabulary link markup needs to be recognized reliably by xlink applications in order to be traversed and handled properly xlink uses the mechanism described in the namespaces in xml recommendation xml names to accomplish recognition of the constructs in the xlink vocabulary the xlink namespace defined by this specification has the following uri httpwwwworgxlink as dictated by xml names the use of xlink elements and attributes requires declaration of the xlink namespace for example the following declaration would make the prefix xlink available within the myelement element to represent the xlink namespace myelement  xmlnsxlinkhttpwwwworgxlink  myelement note most code examples in this specification do not show an xlink namespace declaration the xlink prefix is used throughout to stand for the declaration of the xlink namespace on elements in whose scope the somarked attribute appears on the same element that bears the attribute or on some ancestor element whether or not an xlink namespace declaration is present in the example xlinks namespace provides global attributes for use on elements that are in any arbitrary namespace the global attributes are type href role arcrole title show actuate label from and to all other attributes and all elements in the xlink namespace are reserved document creators use the xlink global attributes to make the elements in their own namespace or even in a namespace they do not control recognizable as xlink elements the type attribute indicates the xlink element type simple extended locator arc resource or title the element type dictates the xlinkimposed constraints that such an element must follow and the behavior of xlink applications on encountering the element following is an example of a crossreference element from a nonxlink namespace that has xlink global attributes mycrossreference  xmlnsmyhttpexamplecom  xmlnsxlinkhttpwwwworgxlink  xlinktypesimple  xlinkhrefstudentsxml  xlinkrolehttpwwwexamplecomlinkpropsstudentlist  xlinktitlestudent list  xlinkshownew  xlinkactuateonrequestcurrent list of studentsmycrossreference using global attributes always requires the use of namespace prefixes on the individual attributes in xml linking language xlink version  xlink elements are identified by the presence of an xlinktype attribute in xlink  xlink elements are identified by the presence of either an xlinktype attribute or an xlinkhref attribute if an element has an xlinktype attribute then that attribute must have one of the following values simple extended locator arc resource or title and the element must adhere to the conformance constraints imposed by that xlink element type if an element has an xlinkhref attribute but does not have an xlinktype attribute then it is treated exactly as if it had an xlinktype attribute with the value simple  xlink attribute usage patterns while the xlink attributes are considered global by virtue of their use of the namespace mechanism their allowed combinations on any one xlink element type depend greatly on the value of the special type attribute see  xlink element type attribute type for more information for the element on which they appear the conformance constraint notes in this specification detail their allowed usage patterns following is a summary of the element types columns on which the global attributes rows are allowed with an indication of whether a value is required r or optional o simple extended locator arc resource title type o r r r r r href o r role o o o o arcrole o o title o o o o o show o o actuate o o label o o from o to o  at least one of type or href must be specified see also b sample dtd c sample xml schema and d sample relax ng grammar for examples of nonnormative schemas that illustrate the allowed patterns of attributes this specification uses the convention xxxtype element to refer to elements that must adhere to a named set of constraints associated with an xlink element type no matter what name the element actually has for example locatortype element would refer to all of the following elements locator xlinktypelocator  loc xlinktypelocator  mypointer xlinktypelocator    xlink element type relationships various xlink element types have special meanings dictated by this specification when they appear as direct children of other xlink element types following is a summary of the child element types that play a significant role in particular parent element types other combinations are not conformant parent type significant child types simple none extended locator arc resource title locator title arc title resource none title none  attribute value defaulting using xlink potentially involves using a large number of attributes for supplying important link information in cases where the values of the desired xlink attributes are unchanging across individual instances in all the documents of a certain type attribute value defaults fixed or not may be added to a dtd or schema so that the attributes do not have to appear physically on element starttags for example if attribute defaults were provided for the xmlnsxlink xmlnsmy type show and actuate attributes in the example in the introduction to  xlink markup design the example would look as follows mycrossreference  xlinkhrefstudentsxml  xlinkrolehttpwwwexamplecomlinkpropsstudentlist  xlinktitlestudent listcurrent list of studentsmycrossreference information sets that have been created under the control of a dtd have all attribute values filled in note however that parsers are not required to process the external subset applications such as web browsers that do not process the external subset will not be aware of any default values identified therein note also that using the attribute value default technique to specify the xlink namespace declaration has no equivalent in relax ng xml schema part  structures or other modern schema languages while it can be used when dtdinformed parsing is performed it poses an interoperability risk and should be used with care  integrating xlink usage with other markup this specification defines only attributes and attribute values in the xlink namespace there is no restriction on using nonxlink attributes alongside xlink attributes in addition most xlink attributes are optional and the choice of simple or extended link is up to the markup designer or document creator so a dtd or other schema that uses xlink features need not use or declare the entire set of xlinks attributes finally while this specification identifies the minimum constraints on xlink markup schemas that use xlink are free to tighten these constraints the use of xlink does not absolve a valid document from conforming to the constraints expressed in its governing schema following is an example of a crossreference element with both xlink and nonxlink attributes mycrossreference  xmlnsmyhttpexamplecom  mylastedited  xmlnsxlinkhttpwwwworgxlink  xlinktypesimple  xlinkhrefstudentsxmlcurrent list of studentsmycrossreference  using xlink with legacy markup because xlinks global attributes require the use of namespace prefixes nonxlinkbased links in legacy documents generally do not serve as conforming xlink constructs as they stand even if attribute value defaulting is used for example xhtml  has an a element with an href attribute but because the attribute is a local one attached to the a element in the xhtml namespace it is not the same as an xlinkhref global attribute in the xlink namespace this specification defines xlink markup that is what combinations xlink attributes and what arrangements of elements with xlink attributes are conformant it also defines the xlink semantics of such conformant markup when xlink is used on elements that have other attributes or related elements with linking semantics xlink can not and does not attempt to define the semantics of such combinations if an element allows such possibly conflicting markup to occur it should specify the semantics of the result  xlink elements and attributes xlink offers two kinds of links extended links extended links offer full xlink functionality such as inbound and thirdparty arcs as well as links that have arbitrary numbers of participating resources as a result their structure can be fairly complex including elements for pointing to remote resources elements for containing local resources elements for specifying arc traversal rules and elements for specifying humanreadable resource and arc titles xlink defines a way to give an extended link special semantics for finding linkbases used in this fashion an extended link helps an xlink application process other links simple links simple links offer shorthand syntax for a common kind of link an outbound link with exactly two participating resources into which category htmlstyle a and img links fall because simple links offer less functionality than extended links they have no special internal structure while simple links are conceptually a subset of extended links they are syntactically different for example to convert a simple link into an extended link several structural changes would be needed the following sections define the xlink elements and attributes  extended links extendedtype element definition an extended link is a link that associates an arbitrary number of resources the participating resources may be any combination of remote and local the only kind of link that is able to have inbound and thirdparty arcs is an extended link typically extended linking elements are stored separately from the resources they associate for example in entirely different documents thus extended links are important for situations where the participating resources are readonly or where it is expensive to modify and update them but inexpensive to modify and update a separate linking element or where the resources are in formats with no native support for embedded links such as many multimedia formats the following diagram shows an extended link that associates five remote resources this could represent for example information about a students course load one resource being a description of the student another being a description of the students academic advisor two resources representing courses that the student is attending and the last resource representing a course that the student is auditing without the extended link the resources might be entirely unrelated for example they might be in five separate documents the lines emanating from the extended link represent the association it creates among the resources however notice that the lines do not have directionality directionality is expressed with traversal rules without such rules being provided the resources are associated in no particular order with no implication as to whether and how individual resources are accessed the following diagram shows an extended link that associates five remote resources and one local resource a special element inside the extended link element this could represent the same sort of courseload example as described above with the addition of the students grade point average stored locally again the lines represent mere association of the six resources without traversal directions or behaviors implied the xlink element type for extended links is any element with an attribute in the xlink namespace called type with a value of extended the extendedtype element may contain a mixture of the following elements in any order possibly along with other content and markup locatortype elements that address the remote resources participating in the link arctype elements that provide traversal rules among the links participating resources titletype elements that provide humanreadable labels for the link resourcetype elements that supply local resources that participate in the link it is not an error for an extendedtype element to associate fewer than two resources if the link has only one participating resource or none at all it is simply untraversable such a link may still be useful for example to associate properties with a single resource by means of xlink attributes or to provide a placeholder for link information that will be populated eventually subelements of the simple or extended type anywhere inside a parent extendedtype element are not conformant subelements of the locator arc or resource type that are not direct children of an extendedtype element are not conformant the extendedtype element may have the semantic attributes role and title see  semantic attributes role arcrole and title they supply semantic information about the link as a whole the role attribute indicates a property that the entire link has and the title attribute indicates a humanreadable description of the entire link it is not conformant for other xlink attributes to be present on the element if both a title attribute and one or more titletype elements are present they have no xlinkspecified relationship a higherlevel application built on xlink will likely want to specify appropriate treatment for example precedence in this case example sample extendedtype element declarations and instance following is a nonnormative set of dtd declarations for an extendedtype element and its subelements parts of this example are reused throughout this specification note that the type attribute and some other attributes are defaulted in the dtd in order to highlight the attributes that are changing on a perinstance basis

resourcetype element an extended link indicates its participating local resources by means of special subelements that appear inside the extended link an entire subelement together with all of its contents makes up a local resource the xlink element for local resources is any element with an attribute in the xlink namespace called type with a value of resource the resourcetype element may have any content whatever content is present has no xlinkspecified relationship to the link it is possible for a resourcetype element to have no content in cases where it serves as a starting resource expected to be traversed on request interactive xlink applications will typically generate some content in order to give the user a way to initiate the traversal if a resourcetype element has anything other than an extendedtype element for a parent the resourcetype element is not conformant the resourcetype element may have the semantic attributes role and title see  semantic attributes role

the label attribute provides a way for an arctype element to refer to it in creating a traversal arc note a locatortype element by itself does not constitute a link just because it has a locator href

extended link arctype element an extended link may indicate rules for traversing among its participating resources by means of a series of optional arc elements the xlink element for arcs is any element with an attribute in the xlink namespace called type with a value of arc the arctype element may have any content other than titletype elements that are direct children see  titles for extended links locators and arcs titletype element whatever content is present has no xlinkspecified relationship to the link if an arctype element has anything other than an extendedtype element for

see  behavior attributes show and actuate  and the semantic attributes arcrole and title see  semantic attributes role arcrole and title the traversal attributes define the desired traversal between pairs of resources that participate in the same link where the resources are identified by their label attribute values the from attribute defines resources from which traversal may be initiated that is starting resources while the to attribute defines resources that may be traversed to that is ending resources the behavior attributes specify the desired behavior for xlink applications to use when traversing to the ending resource the semantic attributes describe the meaning of the arcs ending resource relative to its starting resource the arcrole attribute corresponds to the rdf notion of a property where the role can be interpreted as stating that startingresource has arcrole endingresource this contextual role can differ from the meaning of an ending resource when taken outside the context of this particular arc for example a resource might generically represent a person but in the context of a particular arc it might have the role of mother and in the context of a different arc it might have the role of daughter when the same resource serves as a starting resource in several arcs whether in a single link or across many links traversalrequest behavior is unconstrained by this specification but one possibility for interactive applications is a popup menu that lists the relevant arc or link titles the following diagram shows an extended link that associates five remote resources and provides rules for traversal among them all of the arcs specified are thirdparty arcs that is the arcs go exclusively between remote resources the nondirectional solid lines indicate as before that the link is associating the five resources the new dotted arrows indicate the traversal rules that the link provides notice that some resources share the same label value this diagram reflects directional traversal arcs created by the following settings where both as and cs are allowed to initiate traversal to all bs because some labels appear on several resources each arc

are to be understood as individual locators rather than as referring to an aggregate resource the traversal behavior of such a link might be the same as for a link where all the locators have different roles and the appropriate arcs are specified to produce the identical traversal pairs if the arc traversal rules for an extended link leave out any possible traversal pairs xlink defines no traversal for these pairs a higherlevel application may perform nonxlinkdirected traversals for example a linkchecking process might traverse all available pairs of resources constraint no arc duplication each arctype element must have a pair of from and to values that does not repeat the from and to values respectively for any other arctype element in the same extended link that is each

for extended links locators and arcs titletype element the extended locator and arctype elements may have the title attribute more about which see  semantic attributes role arcrole and title however they may also have a series of one or more titletype elements such elements are useful for example for cases where humanreadable label information needs further element markup or where multiple titles are necessary one common motivation for using the titletype element is to account for internationalization and localization for example title markup might be necessary for bidirectional contexts or in east asian languages and multiple titles might be necessary for different naturallanguage versions of a title see ruby annotation for examples where markup might be necessary inside a title the xlink element for titles is any element with an attribute in the xlink namespace called type with a value of title the titletype element may have any content if a titletype element contains nested xlink elements such contained elements have no xlinkspecified relationship to the parent link containing the title if a titletype element has anything other than an extended locator or arctype element for a

xlink application to traverse from a starting resource to an ending resource it needs to locate both the starting resource and the link locating the two pieces is not a problem in the case of outbound arcs because the starting resource is either the linking element itself or a child of the linking element however in the case of inbound and thirdparty arcs the xlink application needs to be able to find both pieces somehow in the course load example extended links can associate pairs of remote resources representing students and courses in order for the system to load and present a student resource such as a description and picture of the person in a way that offers traversal to related information for example by allowing users to click on the students name to traverse to information about the courses in which she is enrolled it needs to locate and use the extended links that contain the association linkbases are often used to make link management easier by gathering together a number of related linking elements xlink provides a way to instruct xlink applications to access potentially relevant linkbases the instruction takes the form of an arc specification whether an explicit one in an extended link or an implicit one in a simple link that has the following value for its arcrole attribute httpwwwworgxlinkpropertieslinkbase constraint linkbases must be xml any linkbase specified as the ending resource of an arc with this special value must be an xml document xlink applications may also use any other means to locate and process additional linkbases the handling of a linkbase arc is much like the handling of a normal arc except that traversal entails loading the ending resource the linkbase to extract its links for later use rather than to present it to a user or to perform some other processing its handling is also special in that xlink applications must suspend traversal of linkbase arcs at user option specifically on loading a linkbase arc an xlink application should keep track of what the starting resource is whenever a document containing that starting resource is loaded and traversal of the linkbase arc is actuated the application should access the linkbase and extract any extended links found inside it in the case that the extracted resource is a portion of a complete xml document such as a range or a string range only those extended links completely contained in the extracted portion should be made available the timing of linkbase arc traversal depends on the value of the actuate attribute on the arc for example if the value is onload the linkbase is loaded and its links extracted as soon as the starting resource is loaded any show attribute value on a linkbase arc must be ignored because traversal does not entail presentation in this case linkbases may be chained by virtue of serving as the starting resource of yet another linkbase arc the application interpreting an initial linkbase arc may choose to limit the number of steps processed in the chain an application should maintain a list of extended links retrieved as a result of processing a linkbase and should not retrieve duplicate resources or links in the case where a cyclic dependency exists to ease xlink processing document creators may wish to define linkbase arcs near the beginning of a document example annotating a specification following

the former to the latter thus a simple link is always an outbound link the purpose of a simple link is to be a convenient shorthand for the equivalent extended link a single simple linking element combines the basic functions of an extendedtype element a locatortype element an arctype element and a resourcetype element the following diagram shows the characteristics of a simple link it associates one local and one remote resource and implicitly provides a single traversal arc from the local resource to the remote one this could represent for example the name of a student appearing in text which when clicked leads to information about the student example simple link functionality done with an extended link a simple link could be represented by an extended link in approximately the following way studentlink xlinktypeextended  resource    xlinktyperesource    xlinklabellocalpat jonesresource  locator    xlinktypelocator    xlinkhref    xlinklabelremote    xlinkrole    xlinktitle   go    xlinktypearc    xlinkfromlocal    xlinktoremote    xlinkarcrole    xlinkshow    xlinkactuate studentlink a simple link combines all the features above except for the types and labels into a single element in cases where only this subset of features is required the xlink simple linking element is available as an alternative to the extended linking element the features missing from simple links are as follows supplying arbitrary numbers of local and remote resources specifying an arc from its remote resource to its local resource associating a title with the single hardwired arc associating a role or title with the local resource associating a role or title with the link as a whole the xlink element for simple links is any element with an attribute in the xlink namespace called type with a value of simple or with an attribute in the xlink namespace called href and no attribute in the xlink namespace called type in this case the value simple is implied for the type attribute in other words the xlink type attribute is optional on xlink simple links the simple equivalent of the above extended link would be as follows studentlink xlinkhrefpat jonesstudentlink the simpletype element may have any content the simpletype element itself together with all of its content is the local resource of the link as if the element were a resourcetype element if a simpletype element contains nested xlink elements such contained elements have no xlinkspecified relationship to the parent link it is possible for a simpletype element to have no content in cases where the link is expected to be traversed on request interactive xlink applications will typically generate some content in order to give the user a way to initiate the traversal the simpletype element effectively takes the locator attribute href and the semantic attributes role and title from the locatortype element and the behavior attributes show and actuate and the single semantic attribute arcrole from the arctype element it is not an error for a simpletype element to have no locator href attribute value if a value is not provided the link is simply untraversable such a link may still be useful for example to associate properties with the resource by means of xlink attributes example sample simpletype element declarations and instance following is a nonnormative

attribute its value must be one of simple extended locator arc resource title or none when the value of the type attribute is none the element has no xlinkspecified meaning and any xlinkrelated

xlink application to find a remote resource or resource fragment is href it may be used on simpletype elements and must be used on locatortype elements the value of the href attribute is a legacy extended iris leiri processing a relative identifier against a base is handled straightforwardly the algorithms of rfc  can be applied directly treating the characters additionally allowed in leiris in the same way that unreserved characters are in uri references note xlink  explicitly did not require applications to check that the value of the xlinkhref attribute conformed to the syntactic rules of a uri while rfc  has clarified the syntactic rules this specification follows the lead of xlink  and many other specifications and does not impose any new conformance testing requirements on xlink applications in this area although xlink applications need not enforce uri syntactic constraints xlink applications which use libraries which do detect violations of the syntactic rules of rfc  should not recover silently if the value of the href attribute is a relative reference as defined in rfc  also known as relative uri in earlier rfcs or results in a relative reference after escaping its absolute version must be computed by the method of xml base before use if a locator includes a fragment identifer the syntax of the fragment identifier is defined by the media type of the representation returned when the locator is dereferenced for locators into xml resources that is resources with the media type applicationxml or media types that defer to the fragment identifier syntax of applicationxml media the syntax of the fragment identifier is expected to be defined by the successor to rfc  technically there is no fragment identifier syntax for xml resources at the time of this writing though the xpointer framework and xpointer element scheme are explicitly supported by several xml vocabularies example sample href attribute declarations following is a nonnormative attributelist declaration for href on an element intended to be simpletype attlist simplelink  xlinkhref      cdata           required    semantic attributes role arcrole and title the attributes that describe the meaning of resources within the context of a link are role arcrole and title the role attribute may be used on extended simple locator and resourcetype elements the arcrole attribute may be used on arc and simpletype elements the title attribute may be used on all of these types of elements the value of the role or arcrole attribute is a legacy extended iris the identifier must not be relative the title attribute is used to describe the meaning of a link or resource in a humanreadable fashion along the same lines as the role or arcrole attribute however see also  titles for extended links locators and arcs titletype element a value is optional if a value is supplied it should contain a string that describes the resource the use of this information is highly dependent on the type of processing being done it may be used for example to make titles available to applications used by visually impaired users or to create a table of links or to present help text that appears when a user lets a mouse pointer hover over a starting resource example sample role and title attribute declarations following is a nonnormative attributelist declaration for role and title on an

not dictate permanent transformation of the starting resource put another way when an embedded xlink is processed the result of styling the ending resource of the link is merged into the result of styling the resource into which it is embedded by contrast when a construct such as an xinclude element is resolved the transformation takes place in the original source document the behavior of conforming xlink applications when embedding xmlbased rfc  ending resources is not defined in this version of this specification the presentation of embedded resources is application dependent other

each location producing a dialog box that allows the reader to choose among the locations as if there were separate arcs leading to each one concatenating the content of all the locations for

             e changes from xlink  nonnormative this specification implements the changes described in extending xlink  these changes make xlink more useful in the places where it is already being used and make it practical in a variety of similar vocabularies it differs from xml linking language xlink version  in the following ways the xlinktype attribute is no longer required for simple links in the absence of any xlinktype attribute an xlink is treated as a simple link where xml linking language xlink version  referred to uris this specification refers to iris this allows a broader range of values for for those properties that are identified with a resource identifier this specification includes nonnormative sample xml schema and relax ng grammars to complement the existing nonnormative sample dtd in addition a few editorial changes have also been made some bibliographic references have been updated to point to more recent specifications the conformance language has been rewritten to support a new simple conformance level for applications that only expect to process simple links several of the examples have been changed to highlight the presence of nonnormative grammars other than the dtd the text describing the interpretation of the locator attribute xlinkhref has been moved into a separate specification legacy extended iris so that it may more easily be reused the locator attribute is now described with reference to that specification
